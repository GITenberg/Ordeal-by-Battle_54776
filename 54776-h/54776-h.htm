<h3>
PREFACE
</h3>

<p>
It is hardly necessary to plead, in extenuation of
those many faults which any impartial reader will
discover in the following pages, the impossibility of
discussing events which are unfolding themselves
around us, in the same detached spirit as if we were
dealing with past history.  The greater part of this
volume has been written in haste, and no one is more
alive to its shortcomings than the author himself.
</p>

<p>
Faults of style are a small matter, and will be
easily forgiven.  It has not been the aim to produce
a work of literary merit, but solely to present a
certain view of public affairs.  It is to be hoped
that actual errors of fact are rare.  Inconsistencies
however&mdash;or apparent inconsistencies&mdash;cannot be
altogether avoided, even by careful revision.  But
the greatest difficulty of all is to keep a true sense
of proportion.
</p>

<p>
In Part I.&mdash;<i>The Causes of War</i>&mdash;an attempt has
been made to state, very briefly, why it has hitherto
proved impossible to eliminate the appeal to arms
from human affairs; to set out the main incidents
which occurred at the opening of the present European
struggle; to explain the immediate occasions, as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Px"></a>x}</span>
well as the more permanent and deep-seated causes,
of this conflict; to consider some of the most glaring
miscalculations which have arisen out of
misunderstanding between nations.
</p>

<p>
In Part II.&mdash;<i>The Spirit of German Policy</i>&mdash;an
attempt has been made to understand the ambitions
of our chief antagonist, and to trace the manner in
which these ambitions have been fostered, forced,
and corrupted by a priesthood of learned men.  The
relations which exist between this Pedantocracy
and the Bureaucracy, the Army, the Rulers, and the
People of Germany have been examined.  It would
appear that under an academic stimulus, healthy
national ambitions have become morbid, have
resulted in the discovery of imaginary grievances, and
have led the Governing Classes of Germany to adopt
a new code of morals which, if universally adhered
to, would make an end of human society.  On the
other hand, it would also appear that the German
People have accepted the policy of their rulers,
without in any way accepting, or even understanding,
the morality upon which this policy is founded.  It
is also important for us to realise the nature of the
judgment&mdash;not altogether unjustified&mdash;which our
enemies have passed upon the British character,
and upon our policy and institutions.
</p>

<p>
In Part III.&mdash;<i>The Spirit of British Policy</i>&mdash;our
own political course since the beginning of the century
has been considered&mdash;the difficulties arising out of
the competition for priority between aims which are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxi"></a>xi}</span>
not in themselves antagonistic: between Social
Reform, Constitutional Reform, and Imperial
Defence&mdash;the confusion which has resulted from the
inadequacy of one small parliament, elected upon a
large variety of cross issues, for dealing with these
diverse needs&mdash;the lowering of the tone of public
life, the depreciation in the character of public men,
which have come about owing to these two causes,
and also to a third&mdash;the steadily increasing tyranny
and corruption of the party machines.
</p>

<p>
The aim of British Foreign Policy has been
simply&mdash;Security.  Yet we have failed to achieve Security,
owing to our blindness, indolence, and lack of
leadership.  We have refused to realise that we were not
living in the Golden Age; that Policy at the last
resort depends on Armaments; that Armaments,
to be effective for their purpose, must correspond
with Policy.  Political leaders of all parties up to
the outbreak of the present war ignored these
essentials; or if they were aware of them, in the
recesses of their own consciousness, they failed to
trust the People with a full knowledge of the dangers
which threatened their Security, and of the means
by which alone these dangers could be withstood.
</p>

<p>
The titles of Parts II. and III. are similar&mdash;<i>The
Spirit of German Policy</i> and <i>The Spirit of British
Policy</i>; but although the titles are similar the treatment
is not the same.  Confession of a certain failure
in proportion must be made frankly.  The two
pieces do not balance.  German Policy is viewed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxii"></a>xii}</span>
from without, at a remote distance, and by an enemy.
It is easier in this case to present a picture which is
clear, than one which is true.  British Policy, on the
of other hand, is viewed from within.  If likewise it
is tinged with prejudice, the prejudice is of a different
character.  Both Parts, I fear, diverge to a greater
or less extent from the main purpose of the book.
Mere excision is easy; but compression is a difficult
and lengthy process, and I have not been able to
carry it so far as I could have wished.
</p>

<p>
In Part IV.&mdash;<i>Democracy and National Service</i>&mdash;an
attempt has been made to deal with a problem
which faces us at the moment.  Democracy is not
unlike other human institutions: it will not stand
merely by its own virtue.  If it lacks the loyalty,
courage, and strength to defend itself when attacked,
it must perish as certainly as if it possessed no virtue
whatsoever.  Manhood suffrage implies manhood
service.  Without the acceptance of this principle
Democracy is merely an imposture.
</p>

<p>
I prefer 'National Service' to 'Conscription,'
not because I shrink from the word 'Conscription,'
but because 'National Service' has a wider sweep.
The greater includes the less.  It is not only military
duties which the State is entitled to command its
citizens to perform unquestioningly in times of
danger; but also civil duties.  It is not only men
between the ages of twenty and thirty-eight to whom
the State should have the right to give orders; but
men and women of all ages.  Under conditions of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxiii"></a>xiii}</span>
modern warfare it is not only armies which need to
be disciplined; but whole nations.  The undisciplined
nation, engaged in anything like an equal contest
with a disciplined nation, will be defeated.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
The Coalition Government
</p>

<p>
This volume was in type before the Coalition
Government was formed; but there is nothing in it
which I wish to change in view of that event.  This
book was not undertaken with the object of helping
the Unionists back into power, or of getting the
Liberals out of power.
</p>

<p>
The new Cabinet contains those members of the
late one in whom the country has most confidence.
Lord Kitchener, Sir Edward Grey, Mr. Lloyd George,
and Mr. Churchill have all made mistakes.  In a
great crisis it is the bigger characters who are most
liable to make mistakes.  Their superiority impels
them to take risks which the smaller men, playing
always for safety, are concerned to avoid.
</p>

<p>
The present Ministry also contains representatives
of that class of politicians which, according to the
view set forth in the following pages, is primarily
responsible for our present troubles.  Lawyer-statesmanship,
which failed to foresee the war, to prepare
against it, and to conduct it with energy and
thoroughness when it occurred, still occupies a large
share of authority.  Possibly ministers of this school
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxiv"></a>xiv}</span>
will now walk in new ways.  In any case, they are
no longer in a position of dangerous predominance.
</p>

<p>
The Coalition Government, having wisely refused
to part with any of those men who rose to the
emergency, and having received an infusion of new
blood (which may be expected to bring an accession
of vigour) starts upon its career with the goodwill
and confidence of the People.
</p>

<p>
What has happened, however, is a revolution
upon an unprecedented scale&mdash;one which is likely to
have vast consequences in the future.  The country
realises this fact, and accepts it as a matter of
course&mdash;accepts it indeed with a sigh of relief.  But in
other quarters, what has just happened is hardly
realised at all&mdash;still less what it is likely to lead to
in the future.
</p>

<p>
During the 'Cabinet Crisis' one read a good deal
of stuff in the newspapers, and heard still more by
word of mouth, which showed how far, during the
past nine months, public opinion has moved away
from the professionals of politics; how little account
it takes of them; also how much these gentlemen
themselves mistake the meaning of the present
situation.
</p>

<p>
In political circles one has heard, and read, very
frequently of late, expressions of regret&mdash;on the one
hand that Unionists should have come to the assistance
of a discredited and bankrupt administration&mdash;on
the other hand that a government, secure in the
confidence of the country, should, through a mistaken
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxv"></a>xv}</span>
sense of generosity, have admitted its opponents
to a share in the glory and prestige of office.  One
has read, and heard, cavillings at the idea of
appointing this, or that, public character to this, or that,
office, as a thing beyond what this, or that, party
'could fairly be expected to stand.'  Reports have
appeared of meetings of 'a hundred' perturbed
Liberals; and very possibly meetings, though
unreported, of equally perturbed Unionists have also
been held.  An idea seems still to be prevalent in
certain quarters, that what has just occurred is
nothing more important than an awkward and
temporary disarrangement of the party game; and
that this game will be resumed, with all the old
patriotism and good feeling, so soon as war is ended.
But this appears to be a mistaken view.  You
cannot make a great mix-up of this sort without
calling new parties into existence.  When men are
thrown into the crucible of a war such as this, the
true ore will tend to run together, the dross to cake
upon the surface.  No matter to what parties they
may have originally owed allegiance, the men who
are in earnest, and who see realities, cannot help but
come together.  May be for several generations the
annual festivals of the National Liberal Federation
and the Union of Conservative Associations will
continue to be held, like other picturesque survivals
of ancient customs.  When Henry VII. was crowned
at Westminster, the Wars of the Roses ended; the old
factions of York and Lancaster were dissolved, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvi"></a>xvi}</span>
made way for new associations.  Something of the
same sort has surely happened during the past
month&mdash;Liberal and Conservative, Radical and Tory
have ceased for the present to be real divisions.  They
had recently become highly artificial and confusing;
now they are gone&mdash;it is to be hoped for ever.
</p>

<p>
Will the generation which is fighting this war&mdash;such
of them as may survive&mdash;be content to go back
to the old barren wrangle when it is done?  Will
those others who have lost husbands, sons, brothers,
friends&mdash;all that was dearest to them except the
honour and safety of their country&mdash;will they be
found willing to tolerate the idea of trusting their
destinies ever again to the same machines, to be driven
once more to disaster by the same automatons?
To all except the automatons themselves&mdash;who share
with the German Supermen the credit of having made
this war&mdash;any such resumption of business on
old-established lines appears incredible.  There is
something pathetic in the sight of these huckstering
sentimentalists still crying their stale wares and
ancient make-believes at the street corners, while
their country is fighting for its life.  They remind
one, not a little, of those Pardoners of the fourteenth
century who, as we read in history books, continued
to hawk their <i>Indulgences</i> with unabated industry
during the days of the <i>Black Death</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvii"></a>xvii}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to offer a few words of explanation
as to how this book came to be written.  During
the months of November and December 1912 and
January 1913, various meetings and discussions took
place under Lord Roberts's roof and elsewhere, between
a small number of persons, who held widely different
views, and whose previous experience and training
had been as different as were their opinions.
</p>

<p>
Our efforts were concerned with endeavouring
to find answers to several questions which had never
been dealt with candidly, clearly, and comprehensively
in the public statements of political leaders.  It
was clear that there was no 'national' policy, which
the British people had grasped, accepted, and
countersigned, as was the case in France.  But some kind
of British policy there must surely be, notwithstanding
the fact it had never been disclosed.  What
were the aims of this policy?  With what nation or
nations were these aims likely to bring us into
collision?  What armaments were necessary in order
to enable us to uphold this policy and achieve these
aims?  How, and when, and where would our
armaments be required in the event of war?
Assuming (as we did in our discussions) that our naval
forces were adequate, was the same statement true
of our military forces?  And if it were not true,
by what means could the necessary increases be
obtained?
</p>

<p>
The final conclusion at which we arrived was
that National Service was essential to security.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxviii"></a>xviii}</span>
Under whatever aspect we regarded the problem we
always returned&mdash;even those of us who were most
unwilling to travel in that direction&mdash;to the same
result.  So long as Britain relied solely upon the
voluntary principle, we should never possess either
the Expeditionary Force or the Army for Home
Defence which were requisite for safety.
</p>

<p>
It fell to me during the winter 1912-1913 to draft
the summary of our conclusions.  It was afterwards
decided&mdash;in the spring of 1913&mdash;that this private
Memorandum should be recast in a popular form
suitable for publication.  I was asked to undertake
this, and agreed to do so.  But I underestimated
both the difficulties of the task and the time which
would be necessary for overcoming them.
</p>

<p>
When we met again, in the autumn of that year,
the work was still far from complete, and by that
time, not only public attention, but our own, had
become engrossed in other matters.  The Irish
controversy had entered upon a most acute and
dangerous stage.  Lord Roberts put off the meetings
which he had arranged to address during the ensuing
months upon National Service, and threw his whole
energies into the endeavour to avert the schism
which threatened the nation, and to find a way to
a peaceful settlement.  Next to the security and
integrity of the British Empire I verily believe that
the thing which lay nearest his heart was the happiness
and unity of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to recall how, during the ensuing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxix"></a>xix}</span>
months, affairs in Ireland continued to march from
bad to worse&mdash;up to the very day when the menace
of the present war suddenly arose before the eyes of
Europe.
</p>

<p>
During August 1914 I went through the old drafts
and memoranda which had now been laid aside for
nearly a year.  Although that very thing had
happened which it had been the object of our efforts
to avert, it seemed to me that there might be
advantages in publishing some portion of our conclusions.
The form, of course, would have to be entirely
different; for the recital of prophecies which had
come true, though it might have possessed a certain
interest for the prophets themselves, could have but
little for the public.
</p>

<p>
Early in September I consulted Lord Roberts,
and also such of my friends, who had originally worked
with me, as were still within reach.  Finding that
their opinion agreed with my own upon the desirability
of publication, I laid out a fresh scheme, and
set to for a third time at the old task.  But as the
work grew, it became clear that it would contain but
little of the former Memorandum, and much which
the former Memorandum had never contemplated.
So many of our original conclusions, laboriously
hammered out to convince the public in the spring
of the year 1913, had become by the autumn of 1914,
the most trite of commonplaces.  And as for the
practical scheme which we had evolved&mdash;endeavouring
to keep our demands at the most modest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxx"></a>xx}</span>
minimum&mdash;it was interesting chiefly by reason of its triviality
when contrasted with the scale of warlike preparations
upon which the Government was now engaged.
Practically, therefore, the whole of the present
volume is new&mdash;not merely redrafted, but for the
most part new in substance.

The author's acknowledgements.
</p>

<p>
I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to the
friends with whom I have studied the problems of
policy and defence for some years past.  The
responsibility for the contents and publication of the
present volume is mine alone; but I have used their
ideas without hesitation, and have drawn largely
upon the notes and memoranda which they drafted
for my assistance.  I wish also to thank several
others&mdash;one in chief&mdash;for the kindness with which,
upon the present occasion, they have given me help
and criticism as these pages were passing through
the press.

There is also another source to which I wish here
gratefully to confess my obligations.  During the
past five years there have appeared in <i>The Round
Table</i> certain articles upon the relations of England
with Germany[<a id="chap00bfn1text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn1">1</a>] which have been characterised by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxi"></a>xxi}</span>
a remarkable degree of prescience and sanity.  At
a certain point, however, there is a difference between
the views expressed in <i>The Round Table</i> and those
expressed in the following pages&mdash;a difference of
stress and emphasis perhaps, rather than of fundamental
opinion, but still a difference of some importance.
I have dealt with this in the concluding
chapter.
</p>

<p>
I should like to make one other acknowledgment
of a different kind.  I have known the editor of <i>The
National Review</i> from a date long before he assumed
his onerous office&mdash;from days when we were
freshmen together by the banks of the Cam.  During a
period of upwards of thirty years, I cannot remember
that I have ever had the good fortune to see absolutely
eye to eye with Mr. Maxse upon any public question.
Even now I do not see eye to eye with him.  In all
probability I never shall.  At times his views have
been in sharp opposition to my own.  But for these
very reasons&mdash;if he will not resent it as an
impertinence&mdash;I should like to say here how greatly I
respect him for three qualities, which have been none
too common among public men in recent times&mdash;first,
for the clearness with which he grasps and
states his beliefs; secondly, for the courageous
constancy with which he holds to them through
good and evil report; thirdly, for the undeviating
integrity of his public career.  Next to Lord Roberts,
he did more perhaps than any other&mdash;though
unavailingly&mdash;to arouse public opinion to the dangers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxii"></a>xxii}</span>
which menaced it from German aggression, to call
attention to the national unpreparedness, and to
denounce the blindness and indolence which treated
warnings with derision.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
Lord Roberts.
</p>

<p>
Lord Roberts's responsibility for the contents
of this volume, as for its publication at the present
time, is nil.  And yet it would never have been
undertaken in the first instance except at his wish,
nor re-undertaken in September last without his
encouragement.  There are probably a good many
besides myself who owe it to his inspiration, that
they first made a serious attempt to study policy
and defence as two aspects of a single problem.  I
also owe to him many things besides this.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances of Lord Roberts's death were
befitting his character and career.  The first great
battle of Ypres was ended.  The British line had held
its own against tremendous odds of men and guns.  He
had no doubt of the ultimate result of the war, and
during his visit to France and Flanders inspired all
who saw him by the quiet confidence of his words and
manner.  After the funeral service at Headquarters a
friend of his and mine wrote to me describing the scene.
The religious ceremony had taken place in the entrance
hall of the Maine at St. Omer.  It was a day of
storms; but as the coffin was borne out "the sun
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxiii"></a>xxiii}</span>
appeared, and made a magnificent rainbow on a
great black block of cloud across the square; and
an airman flew across from the rainbow into the
sunlight."
</p>

<p>
If I were asked to name Lord Roberts's highest
intellectual quality I should say unhesitatingly that
it was his instinct.  And if I were asked to name
his highest moral quality I should say, also
unhesitatingly, that it was the unshakeable
confidence with which he trusted his instinct.  But the
firmness of his trust was not due in the least to
self-conceit, or arrogance, or obstinacy.  He obeyed his
instinct as he obeyed his conscience&mdash;humbly and
devoutly.  The dictates of both proceeded from the
same source.  It was not his own cleverness which
led him to his conclusions, but the hand of Providence
which drew aside a veil, and enabled him to see the
truth.  What gave him his great strength in counsel,
as in the field, was the simple modesty of his
confidence.
</p>

<p>
He was a poor arguer; I think argument was
painful to him; also that he regarded it as a sad
waste of the short span of human life.  It was not
difficult to out-argue him.  Plausible and
perspicacious persons often left him, after an
interview, under the firm impression that they had
convinced him.  But as a rule, he returned on the
morrow to his old opinion, unless his would-be
converters had brought to his notice new facts as
well as new arguments.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxiv"></a>xxiv}</span>
</p>

<p>
He arrived at an opinion neither hastily nor slowly,
but at a moderate pace.  He had the gift of stating
his conclusion with admirable lucidity; and if he
thought it desirable, he gave the reasons for his view
of the matter with an equal clearness.  But his
reasons, like his conclusion, were in the nature of
statements; they were not stages in an argument.
There are as many unanswerable reasons to be given
for as against most human decisions.  Ingenuity and
eloquence are a curse at councils of war, and state,
and business.  Indeed, wherever action of any kind
has to be determined upon they are a curse.  It was
Lord Roberts's special gift that, out of the medley of
unanswerable reasons, he had an instinct for selecting
those which really mattered, and keeping his
mind close shut against the rest.
</p>

<p>
It is superfluous to speak of his courtesy of manner
and kindness of heart, or of his unflagging devotion&mdash;up
till the very day of his death&mdash;to what he regarded
as his duty.  There is a passage in Urquhart's
translation of <i>Rabelais</i> which always recalls him to my
mind:&mdash;<i>He was the best little great good man that ever
girded a sword on his side; he took all things in good
part, and interpreted every action in the best sense</i>.
In a leading German newspaper there appeared,
a few days after his death, the following reference
to that event:&mdash;"It was not given to Lord Roberts
to see the realisation of his dreams of National
Service; but the blows struck on the Aisne
were hammer-strokes which might after a long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxv"></a>xxv}</span>
time and bitter need produce it.  Lord Roberts
was an honourable and, through his renown, a
dangerous enemy ... personally an extraordinarily
brave enemy.  Before such a man we lower our
swords, to raise them again for new blows dealt
with the joy of conflict."
</p>

<p>
Nor was this the only allusion of the kind which
figured in German newspapers 'to the journey of
an old warrior to Walhalla,' with his final mission
yet unaccomplished, but destined to be sooner or
later accomplished, if his country was to survive.
In none of these references, so far as I have been
able to discover, was there the least trace of malice
against the man who had warned his fellow-countrymen,
more clearly than any other, against
the premeditated aggression of Germany.  This
seems very strange when we recollect how, for
nearly two years previously, a large section of the
British nation had been engaged in denouncing
Lord Roberts for the outrageous provocations which
he was alleged to have offered to Germany&mdash;in
apologising to Germany for his utterances&mdash;in
suggesting the propriety of depriving him of his
pension in the interests of Anglo-German amity.
What this section has itself earned in the matter of
German gratitude we know from many hymns and
other effusions of hate.

<p class="t3b">
Hugh Dawnay and John Gough.
</p>

<p>
I have dedicated this volume to the memory of
John Gough and Hugh Dawnay, not solely on grounds
of friendship, but also because from both I received,
at different times, much help, advice, and
criticism&mdash;from the latter when the original Memorandum
was in course of being drafted&mdash;from both when it
was being reconsidered with a view to publication.
Whether either of them would agree with the statement
in its present form is more than I can venture
to say, and I have no intention of claiming their
authority for conclusions which were never seen by
them in final shape.
</p>

<p>
In the first instance (November 1912-March 1913)
Dawnay[<a id="chap00bfn2text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn2">2</a>] and I worked together.  His original notes
and memoranda are to a large extent incorporated
in Parts III. and IV.&mdash;so closely, however, that
I cannot now disentangle his from my own.  The
calculations as to numbers and probable distribution
of the opposing forces, were almost entirely his.  I
have merely endeavoured here&mdash;not so successfully
as I could wish&mdash;to bring them up to the date of the
outbreak of war.
</p>

<p>
Dawnay took out his squadron of the 2nd Life
Guards to France early in August.  Already, however,
he had been appointed to the Headquarters General
Staff, on which he served with distinction, until
early in October, when he succeeded to the command
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxvii"></a>xxvii}</span>
of his regiment.  He fell at Zwarteleen near Ypres
on the 6th of November 1914&mdash;one of the most
anxious days during the four weeks' battle.
</p>

<p>
His friends have mourned his death, but none
of them have grudged it; for he died, not merely
as a brave man should&mdash;in the performance of his
duty&mdash;but after having achieved, with consummate
skill and daring, his part in an action of great
importance.  On the afternoon of this day General
Kavanagh's Brigade of Household Cavalry[<a id="chap00bfn3text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn3">3</a>]&mdash;summoned
in haste&mdash;dismounted, and threw back a
German attack which had partially succeeded in
piercing the allied line at the point of junction between
the French and English forces.  This successful
counter-attack saved the right flank of Lord Cavan's
Guards' Brigade from a position of extreme danger,
which must otherwise, almost certainly, have resulted
in a perilous retreat.  The whole of this Homeric
story is well worth telling, and some day it may be
told; but this is not the place.
</p>

<p>
Dawnay was fortunate inasmuch as he lost his
life, not as so many brave men have done in this
war&mdash;and in all others&mdash;by a random bullet, or as the
result of somebody's blunder, or in an attempt which
failed.  On the contrary he played a distinguished,
and possibly a determining part, in an action which
succeeded, and the results of which were fruitful.
</p>

<p>
He was not merely a brave and skilful soldier
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxviii"></a>xxviii}</span>
when it came to push of pike, but a devoted student
of his profession in times of peace.  The mixture
of eagerness and patience with which he went about
his work reminded one, not a little, of that same
combination of qualities as it is met with sometimes
among men of science.
</p>

<p>
Hunting accidents, the privations of Ladysmith
followed by enteric, divers fevers contracted in
hot climates, and the severity of a campaign in
Somaliland, had severely tried his constitution&mdash;which
although vigorous and athletic was never robust&mdash;and
had increased a tendency to headaches and
neuralgia to which he had been subject ever since
boyhood.  Yet he treated pain always as a despicable
enemy, and went about his daily business as
indefatigably when he was in suffering, as when he was
entirely free from it, which in later years was but rarely.
</p>

<p>
Dawnay had a very quick brain, and held his
views most positively.  It was sometimes said of him
that he did not suffer fools gladly, and this was true
up to a point.  He was singularly intolerant of
presumptuous fools, who laid down the law about
matters of which they were wholly ignorant, or
who&mdash;having acquired a smattering of second-hand
knowledge&mdash;proceeded to put their ingenious and sophistical
theories into practice.  But for people of much
slower wits than himself&mdash;if they were trying honestly
to arrive at the truth&mdash;he was usually full of
sympathy.  His tact and patience upon great occasions
were two of his noblest qualities.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxix"></a>xxix}</span>
</p>

<p>
In some ways he used to remind me, not a little,
of Colonel Henry Esmond of Castlewood, Virginia.
In both there was the same hard core of resistance
against anything, which appeared to challenge certain
adamantine principles concerning conduct befitting
a gentleman.  On such matters he was exceedingly
stiff and unyielding.  And he resembled the friend
of Lord Bolingbroke, and General Webb, and Dick
Steele also in this, that he was addicted to the figure
of irony when crossed in discussion.  One imagines,
however, that Colonel Esmond must have kept his
countenance better, and remained imperturbably
grave until his shafts had all gone home.  In
Dawnay's case the sight of his opponent's lengthening
face was, as a rule, too much for his sense of humour,
and the attack was apt to lose some of its force&mdash;certainly
all its fierceness&mdash;in a smile which reminded
one of Carlyle's description&mdash;'sunlight on the sea.'
</p>

<p>
The following extract from a letter written by
one of his friends who had attended the War Service
at St. Paul's gives a true picture: "A sudden vision
arose in my imagination of Hugh Dawnay striding
down the choir, in full armour, like St. Michael&mdash;with
his head thrown back, and that extraordinary
expression of resolution which he always seemed to
me to possess more than any one I have ever seen.
His wide-apart eyes had more of the spirit of truth
in them than almost any&mdash;also an intolerance of
falsehood&mdash;or rather perhaps a disbelief in its
existence...."  This is true.  He was one of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxx"></a>xxx}</span>
that race of men whose recumbent figures are seen
in our old churches and cathedrals, with hands
clasping crusaders' swords against their breasts,
their hounds couching at their feet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In physique and temperament Hugh Dawnay
and John Gough[<a id="chap00bfn4text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn4">4</a>] were in most respects as unlike a
pair of friends as ever walked this earth; but we
might have searched far before we could have found
two minds which, on most matters connected with
their profession, were in more perfect accord.  Dawnay,
younger by four years, had served under Gough in
trying times, and regarded him (an opinion which
is very widely shared by seniors as well as juniors)
as one of the finest soldiers of his age.  Though
Dawnay was slender and of great height, while
Gough was rather below the middle stature, broad
and firmly knit, there was one striking point of
physical resemblance between them, in the way their
heads were set upon their shoulders.  There was
something in the carriage of both which seemed to
take it for granted that they would be followed
wherever they might chose to lead.  In Lord Roberts,
and also in a strikingly different
character&mdash;Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;there was the same poise, the same
stable equilibrium, without a trace in it of
self-consciousness or constraint.  It may be that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxxi"></a>xxxi}</span>
habit of command induces this bearing in a man;
or it may be that there is something in the nature of
the man who bears himself thus which forces him
to become a leader.
</p>

<p>
Gough took no part in the preparation of the
original Memorandum; but in March 1913 he
discussed it with me[<a id="chap00bfn5text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn5">5</a>] and made various criticisms
and suggestions, most of which have been incorporated
here.  His chief concern with regard to all proposals
for a National Army was, that the period of training
should be sufficient to allow time for turning the
average man into a soldier who had full confidence
in himself.  "When war breaks out"&mdash;I can hear his
words&mdash;"it's not recruits we want: it's soldiers we
want: that is, if our object is to win the war as
speedily as possible, and to lose as few lives as
possible."  Under normal peace conditions he put
this period at a minimum of two years for infantry;
but of course he would have admitted&mdash;and did,
in fact, admit when I saw him last December&mdash;that
under the stress and excitement of war the term might
be considerably shortened.
</p>

<p>
His chief concern in 1913 was with regard to
shortage of officers.  He criticised with great severity
the various recent attempts at reforming our military
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxxii"></a>xxxii}</span>
system, not only on the ground that we had chosen
to rely upon training our national forces after war
had actually broken out (in his view a most disastrous
decision); but also because we had not taken care
to provide ourselves against the very emergency
which was contemplated, by having a reserve of
officers competent to undertake the training of the
new army in case of need.
</p>

<p>
I went to see him at Aldershot on the Friday
before war was declared, and found, as I expected,
that he regarded it as inevitable.  He had undergone
a very severe operation in the early summer, and was
still quite unfit to stand the strain of hard exercise.
It had been arranged that we were to go together,
a few days later, to Sweden, for six weeks' shooting
and fishing in the mountains.  He was very anxious
to return to England for the September manoeuvres.
His surgeon,[<a id="chap00bfn6text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn6">6</a>] however, forbade this, on the ground
that even by that time he would not be fit to sit
for a whole day in the saddle.
</p>

<p>
He was in two moods on this occasion.  He was as
light-hearted as a boy who is unexpectedly released
from school; the reason being that the Army Medical
Officer had that morning passed him as physically fit
to go abroad with Sir Douglas Haig, to whom he had
acted as Senior Staff Officer since the previous autumn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxxiii"></a>xxxiii}</span>
</p>

<p>
His other mood was very different.  The war
which he had foreseen and dreaded, the war which
in his view might have been avoided upon one
condition, and one only&mdash;if England had been
prepared&mdash;had come at last.  I don't think I have ever known
any one&mdash;certainly never any anti-militarist&mdash;whose
hatred and horror of war gave the same impression
of intensity and reality as his.  Not metaphorically,
but as a bare fact, his feelings with regard to it were
too deep for words; he would suddenly break off
speaking about things which had occurred in his
own experience; in particular, about loss of friends
and comrades.  He was an Irishman, and had not
the impassive coldness of some of the great soldiers.
But most of all he hated war when it was not
inevitable&mdash;when with foresight and courage it might
have been averted&mdash;as in his opinion this war might
have been.
</p>

<p>
In radium there is said to be a virtue which
enables it to affect adjacent objects with its own
properties, and to turn them, for a time, and for
certain purposes, into things of the same nature
as itself.  Certain rare human characters possess a
similar virtue; but although I have met with several
of these in my life, there is none of them all who
seemed to me to possess this quality in quite so high
a degree as Gough.  He was an alchemist who made
fine soldiers out of all sorts and conditions of men,
and whose spirit turned despondency out of doors.
</p>

<p>
The clearness of his instinct and the power of his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxxiv"></a>xxxiv}</span>
mind were not more remarkable than his swiftness
of decision and indomitable will.  There are
scores&mdash;probably hundreds&mdash;of young officers who fought
by his side, or under him, at Ypres and elsewhere,
who years hence, when they are themselves
distinguished&mdash;perhaps great and famous&mdash;and come,
in the evening of their days, to reckon up and
consider the influences which have shaped their careers,
will place his influence first.  And there are boys
looking forward to the day when they shall be old
enough to serve in the King's Army, chiefly from
the love and honour in which they held this hero,
with his winning smile and superb self-confidence.
</p>

<p>
He has left behind him a tradition, if ever man
did.  You will find it everywhere, among young and
old&mdash;among all with whom he ever came into touch.
Nor is the tradition which he has left merely among
soldiers and with regard to the art of war, but also
in other spheres of private conduct and public life.
He had strong prejudices as well as affections, which
made him sometimes judge men unfairly, also on
the other hand too favourably; but he banished
all meanness from his neighbourhood, all thoughts
of self-interest and personal advancement.  Duty,
discipline, self-discipline, and the joy of life&mdash;these
were the rules he walked by; and if you found
yourself in his company you had perforce to walk with
him, keeping up with his stride as best you could.
</p>

<p>
We value our friends for different qualities, and
would have their tradition fulfil itself in different
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxxxv"></a>xxxv}</span>
ways.  Those of us who counted these two&mdash;'Johnnie'
Gough and Hugh Dawnay&mdash;among our friends will
wish that our sons may be like them, and follow
in their footsteps.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
PEACE AND WAR
</h3>

<p>
It is a considerable number of years since the most
distinguished Tory statesman of his time impressed
upon his fellow-countrymen as a maxim of policy,
that <i>Peace is the greatest of British interests</i>.  There
was an unexpectedness about Lord Salisbury's words,
coming as they did from the leader of a party which
had hitherto lain under suspicion of jingoism, which
gave the phrase almost the colour of an epigram.
The truth of the saying, however, gradually became
manifest to all men; and thereupon a new danger
arose out of this very fact.
</p>

<p>
As a nation we are in some ways a great deal
too modest; or it may be, looking at the matter
from a critical standpoint, too self-centred.  We
have always been inclined to assume in our calculations
that we ourselves are the only possible disturbers
of the peace, and that if we do not seek war, or
provoke it, no other Power will dream of forcing war
upon us.  This unfortunately has rarely been the
case; and those persons who, in recent times, have
refused most scornfully to consider the lessons of
past history, have now at last learned from a sterner
schoolmaster the falseness of their favourite doctrine.
</p>

<p>
The United Kingdom needed and desired peace, so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
that it might proceed undistracted, and with firm
purpose, to set its house in order.  The Dominions
needed peace, so that they might have time to people
their fertile but empty lands, to strike deep roots
and become secure.  To the Indian Empire and the
Dependencies peace was essential, if a system of
government, which aimed, not unsuccessfully, at
giving justice and fostering well-being, was to
maintain its power and prestige unshaken.  The whole
British race had nothing material to gain by war,
but much to lose, much at any rate which would be
put in jeopardy by war.  In spite of all these weighty
considerations which no man of sense and knowledge
will venture to dispute, we should have been wiser
had we taken into account the fact, that they did not
apply to other nations, that in the main they affected
ourselves alone, and that our case was no less singular
than, in one sense at all events, it was fortunate.
</p>

<p>
We did not covet territory or new subjects.  Still
less were we likely to engage in campaigns out of a
thirst for glory.  In the latter particular at least we
were on a par with the rest of the world.  The cloud
of anxiety which for ten or more years has brooded
over the great conscript nations, growing steadily
darker, contained many dangers, but among these
we cannot reckon such antiquated motives as trivial
bravado, light-hearted knight-errantry, or the vain
pursuit of military renown.
</p>

<p>
What is called in history books 'an insult' seemed
also to have lost much of its ancient power for plunging
nations into war.  The Chancelleries of Europe had
grown cautious, and were on the watch against being
misled by the emotions of the moment.  A sensational
but unintended injury was not allowed to drive us
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
into war with Russia in 1904, and this precedent
seemed of good augury.  Moreover, when every
statesman in Europe was fully alive to the electric
condition of the atmosphere, a deliberate insult was
not very likely to be offered from mere ill-manners
or in a fit of temper, but only if there were some
serious purpose behind it, in which case it would fall
under a different category.
</p>

<p>
Fear was a great danger, and everybody knew it
to be so&mdash;fear lest this nation, or that, might be
secretly engaged in strengthening its position in order
to crush one of its neighbours at some future date,
unless that neighbour took time by the forelock and
struck out forthwith.  Among the causes which
might bring about a surprise outbreak of war this was
the most serious and probable.  It was difficult to
insure against it.  But though perilous in the extreme
while it lasts, panic is of the nature of an epidemic:
it rages for a while and passes away.  It had been
raging now with great severity ever since 1909,[<a id="chap0101fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn1">1</a>] and
by midsummer 1914 optimists were inclined to seek
consolation in the thought that the crisis must surely
be over.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DANGERS TO PEACE
</span>
</p>

<p>
More dangerous to peace in the long run even than
fear, were certain aims and aspirations, which from
one standpoint were concrete and practical, but
regarded from another were among the cloudiest of
abstractions&mdash;'political interests,' need of new
markets, hunger for fresh territory to absorb the
outflow of emigrants, and the like; on the other
hand, those hopes and anxieties which haunt the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
imaginations of eager men as they look into the
future, and dream dreams and see visions of a grand
national fulfilment.
</p>

<p>
If the British race ever beheld a vision of this sort,
it had been realised already.  We should have been
wise had we remembered that this accomplished
fact, these staked-out claims of the British Empire,
appeared to fall like a shadow across visions seen
by other eyes, blotting out some of the fairest hopes,
and spoiling the noble proportions of the patriot's
dream.
</p>

<p>
There is a region where words stumble after truth,
like children chasing a rainbow across a meadow to
find the pot of fairy gold.  Multitudinous volumes
stuffed with the cant of pacifism and militarism will
never explain to us the nature of peace and war.  But
a few bars of music may sometimes make clear things
which all the moralists, and divines, and philosophers&mdash;even
the poets themselves for the most part, though
they come nearer to it at times than the rest&mdash;have
struggled vainly to show us in their true proportions.
The songs of a nation, its national anthems&mdash;if they
be truly national and not merely some commissioned
exercise&mdash;are better interpreters than state papers.
A man will learn more of the causes of wars, perhaps
even of the rights and wrongs of them, by listening
to the burst and fall of the French hymn, the ebb
and surge of the Russian, in Tschaikovsky's famous
overture, than he ever will from books or speeches,
argument or oratory.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
IMPOTENCE OF LOGIC
</span>
</p>

<p>
Yet there are people who think it not impossible
to prove to mankind by logical processes, that the
loss which any great nation must inevitably sustain
through war, will far outweigh any advantages which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
can ensue from it, even if the arms of the conqueror
were crowned with victories greater than those of
Caesar or Napoleon.  They draw us pictures of the
exhaustion which must inevitably follow upon such
a struggle conducted upon the modern scale, of the
stupendous loss of capital, destruction of credit,
paralysis of industry, arrest of progress in things
spiritual as well as temporal, the shock to civilisation,
and the crippling for a generation, probably for
several generations, possibly for ever, of the victorious
country in its race with rivals who have wisely stood
aside from the fray.  These arguments may conceivably
be true, may in no particular be over-coloured,
or an under-valuation, either of the good which has
been attained by battle, or of the evils which have
been escaped.  But they would be difficult to
establish even before an unbiassed court, and they are
infinitely more difficult to stamp upon popular
belief.
</p>

<p>
It is not sufficient either with statesmen or
peoples to set before them a chain of reasoning which
is logically unanswerable.  Somehow or other the
new faith which it is desired to implant, must be
rendered independent of logic and unassailable by
logic.  It must rise into a higher order of convictions
than the intellectual before it can begin to operate
upon human affairs.  For it is matched against
opinions which have been held and acted upon so
long, that they have become unquestionable save
in purely academic discussions.  At those decisive
moments, when action follows upon thought like a
flash, conclusions which depend upon a train of
reasoning are of no account: instinct will always
get the better of any syllogism.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
</p>

<p>
So when nations are hovering on the brink of war,
it is impulse, tradition, or some stuff of the
imagination&mdash;misused deliberately, as sometimes happens,
by crafty manipulators&mdash;which determines action
much more often than the business calculations of
shopkeepers and economists.  Some cherished
institution seems to be threatened.  Some nationality
supposed&mdash;very likely erroneously&mdash;to be of the same
flesh and blood as ourselves, appears&mdash;very likely
on faulty information&mdash;to be unjustly oppressed.
Two rival systems of civilisation, of morals, of religion,
approach one another like thunder-clouds and come
together in a clash.  Where is the good at such times
of casting up sums, and exhibiting profit-and-loss
accounts to the public gaze?  People will not listen,
for in their view considerations of prosperity and
the reverse are beside the question.  Wealth, comfort,
even life itself, are not regarded; nor are the possible
sufferings of posterity allowed to count any more than
the tribulations of to-day.  In the eyes of the people
the matter is one of duty not of interest.  When men
fight in this spirit the most lucid exposition of material
drawbacks is worse than useless; for the national
mood, at such moments, is one of self-sacrifice.  The
philosopher, or the philanthropist, is more likely to
feed the flames than to put them out when he proves
the certainty of loss and privation, and dwells upon
the imminent peril of ruin and destruction.
</p>

<p>
The strength of the fighter is the strength of his
faith.  Each new Gideon who goes out against the
Midianites fancies that the sword of the Lord is in
his hand.  He risks all that he holds dear, in order
that he may pull down the foul images of Baal and
build up an altar to Jehovah, in order that his race
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
may not be shorn of its inheritance, in order that it
may hold fast its own laws and institutions, and not
pass under the yoke of the Gentiles.  This habit of
mind is unchanging throughout the ages.  What
moved men to give their lives at Marathon moved
them equally, more than a thousand years later, to
offer the same sacrifice under the walls of Tours.
It is still moving them, after yet another thousand
years and more have passed away, in the plains of
Flanders and the Polish Marshes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE MOTIVES OF NATIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
When the Persian sought to force the dominion
of his ideals upon the Greek, the states of Hellas made
head against him from the love and honour in which
they held their own.  When the successors of the
Prophet, zealous for their faith, confident in the
protection of the One God, drove the soldiers of the
Cross before them from the passes of the Pyrenees to
the vineyards of Touraine, neither side would have
listened with any patience to a dissertation upon the
inconveniences resulting from a state of war and upon
the economic advantages of peace.  It was there one
faith against another, one attitude towards life against
another, one system of manners, customs, and laws
against another.  When a collision occurs in this region
of human affairs there is seldom room for compromise
or adjustment.  Things unmerchantable cannot be
purchased with the finest of fine gold.
</p>

<p>
In these instances, seen by us from far off, the truth
of this is easily recognised.  But what some of our
recent moralists have overlooked, is the fact that
forces of precisely the same order exist in the world
of to-day, and are at work, not only among the fierce
Balkan peoples, in the resurgent empire of Japan,
and in the great military nations&mdash;the French, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
Germans, and the Russians&mdash;but also in America
and England.  The last two pride themselves upon
a higher civilisation, and in return are despised by
the prophets of militarism as worshippers of material
gain.  The unfavourable and the flattering estimate
agree, however, upon a single point&mdash;in assuming that
our own people and those of the United States are
unlikely to yield themselves to unsophisticated
impulse.  This assumption is wholly false.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
VIRTUES OF THE WAR SPIRIT
</span>
</p>

<p>
If we search carefully, we shall find every where
underlying the great struggles recorded in past history,
no less than those which have occurred, and are now
occurring, in our own time, an antagonism of one
kind or another between two systems, visions, or
ideals, which in some particular were fundamentally
opposed and could not be reconciled.  State papers
and the memoranda of diplomatists, when in due
course they come to light, are not a little apt to
confuse the real issues, by setting forth a diary of minor
incidents and piquant details, not in their true
proportions, but as they appeared at the moment of their
occurrence to the eyes of harassed and suspicious
officials.  But even so, all the emptying of desks and
pigeon-holes since the great American Civil War, has
not been able to cover up the essential fact, that in
this case a million lives were sacrificed by one of the
most intelligent, humane, and practical nations upon
earth, and for no other cause than that there was an
irreconcilable difference amongst them, with regard
to what St.  Paul has called 'the substance of things
hoped for.'  On the one side there was an ideal of
Union and a determination to make it prevail: on
the other side there was an ideal of Independence
and an equal determination to defend it whatsoever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
might be the cost.  If war on such grounds be possible
within the confines of a single nation, nurtured in
the same traditions, and born to a large extent of the
same stock, how futile is the assurance that economic
and material considerations will suffice to make war
impossible between nations, who have not even the
tie of a common mother-tongue!
</p>

<p>
A collision may occur, as we know only too well,
even although one of two vessels be at anchor, if it
happens to lie athwart the course of the other.  It
was therefore no security against war that British
policy did not aim at any aggrandisement or seek for
any territorial expansion.  The essential questions
were&mdash;had we possessions which appeared to obstruct
the national aspirations and ideals of others; and
did these others believe that alone, or in alliance,
they had the power to redress the balance?
</p>

<p>
The real difficulty which besets the philanthropist
in his endeavour to exorcise the spirit of war is caused,
not by the vices of this spirit, but by its virtues.  In
so far as it springs from vainglory or cupidity, it is
comparatively easy to deal with.  In so far as it is
base, there is room for a bargain.  It can be
compounded with and bought off, as we have seen before
now, with some kind of material currency.  It will
not stand out for very long against promises of
prosperity and threats of dearth.  But where, as at
most crises, this spirit is not base, where its impulse
is not less noble, but more noble than those which
influence men day by day in the conduct of their
worldly affairs, where the contrast which presents
itself to their imagination is between duty on the
one hand and gain on the other, between self-sacrifice
and self-interest, between their country's need and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
their own ease, it is not possible to quench the fires
by appeals proceeding from a lower plane.  The
philanthropist, if he is to succeed, must take still
higher ground, and higher ground than this it is not
a very simple matter to discover.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
THE OUTBREAK OF WAR
</h3>

<p>
When war came, it came suddenly.  A man who
had happened to fall sick of a fever on St. Swithin's
day 1914, but was so far on the way to convalescence
four weeks later as to desire news of the outside
world, must have been altogether incredulous of the
tidings which first greeted his ears.
</p>

<p>
When he fell ill the nations were at peace.  The
townspeople of Europe were in a holiday humour,
packing their trunks and portmanteaus for 'land
travel or sea-faring.'  The country people were
getting in their harvest or looking forward hopefully
to the vintage.  Business was prosperous.  Credit
was good.  Money, in banking phraseology, was
'cheap.'  The horror of the Serajevo assassinations
had already faded almost into oblivion.  At the
worst this sensational event was only an affair of
police.  Such real anxiety as existed in the United
Kingdom had reference to Ireland.
</p>

<p>
We can imagine the invalid's first feeble question
on public affairs:&mdash;'What has happened in Ulster?'&mdash;The
answer, 'Nothing has happened in Ulster.'&mdash;The
sigh of relief with which he sinks back on his pillows.
</p>

<p>
When, however, they proceed to tell him what
has happened, elsewhere than in Ulster, during the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
four weeks while they have been watching by his
bedside, will he not fancy that his supposed recovery is
only an illusion, and that he is still struggling with
the phantoms of his delirium?
</p>

<p>
For what will they have to report?  That the
greater part of the world which professes Christianity
has called out its armies; that more than half Europe
has already joined battle; that England, France,
Russia, Belgium, Servia, and Montenegro on the one
side are ranged against Germany and Austria on the
other.  Japan, they will tell him, is upon the point of
declaring war.  The Turk is wondering if, and when,
he may venture to come in; while the Italian, the
Roumanian, the Bulgar, the Greek, the Dutchman, the
Dane, and the Swede are reckoning no less anxiously
for how short or long a period it may still be safe for
them to stand out.  Three millions of men, or
thereabouts&mdash;a British Army included&mdash;are advancing
against one another along the mountain barriers of
Luxemburg, Lorraine, and Alsace.  Another three
millions are engaged in similar evolutions among the
lakes of East Prussia, along the river-banks of Poland,
and under the shadow of the Carpathians.  A large
part of Belgium is already devastated, her villages
are in ashes or flames, her eastern fortresses invested,
her capital threatened by the invader.
</p>

<p>
Nine-tenths or more of the navies of the world
are cleared for action, and are either scouring the
seas in pursuit, or are withdrawn under the shelter
of land-batteries watching their opportunity for a
stroke.  Air-craft circle by day and night over the
cities, dropping bombs, with a careless and impartial
aim, upon buildings both private and public, both
sacred and profane, upon churches, palaces, hospitals,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
and arsenals.  The North Sea and the Baltic are
sown with mines.  The trade of the greater part
of industrial Europe is at a standstill; the rest is
disorganised; while the credit and finances, not merely
of Europe, but of every continent, are temporarily
in a state either of chaos or paralysis.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A NIGHTMARE
</span>
</p>

<p>
To the bewildered convalescent all this may well
have seemed incredible.  It is hardly to be wondered
at if he concluded that the fumes of his fever were
not yet dispersed, and that this frightful phantasmagoria
had been produced, not by external realities,
but by the disorders of his own brain.
</p>

<p>
How long it might have taken to convince him
of the truth and substance of these events we may
judge from our own recent experience.  How long
was it after war broke out, before even we, who had
watched the trouble brewing through all its stages,
ceased to be haunted, even in broad daylight, by the
feeling that we were asleep, and that the whole thing
was a nightmare which must vanish when we awoke?
We were faced (so at least it seemed at frequent
moments) not by facts, but by a spectre, and one by
no means unfamiliar&mdash;the spectre of Europe at
war, so long dreaded by some, so scornfully derided
by others, so often driven away, of late years so
persistently reappearing.  But this time the thing
refused to be driven away.  It sat, hunched up, with
its head resting on its hands, as pitiless and inhuman
as one of the gargoyles on a Gothic cathedral, staring
through us, as if we were merely vapour, at something
beyond.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So late as Wednesday, July 29&mdash;the day on
which Austria declared war on Servia&mdash;there was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
probably not one Englishman in a hundred who
believed it possible that, within a week, his own
country would be at war; still less, that a few days
later the British Army would be crossing the Channel
to assist France and Belgium in repelling a German
invasion.  To the ordinary man&mdash;and not merely
to the ordinary man, but equally to the press, and the
great majority of politicians&mdash;such things were
unthinkable until they occurred.  Unfortunately, the
inability to think a thing is no more a protection
against its occurrence than the inability to see a thing
gives security to the ostrich.
</p>

<p>
The sequence of events which led up to the
final disaster is of great importance, although very
far from being in itself a full explanation of the
causes.
</p>

<p>
On June 28, 1914, the heir to the throne of
Austria-Hungary, together with his consort, was murdered
by a young Bosnian at Serajevo, not far distant from
the southern frontier.  The Imperial authorities
instituted a secret enquiry into the circumstances of
the plot, as a result of which they professed to have
discovered that it had been hatched at Belgrade,
that Government officials were implicated in it, and
that so far from being reprobated, it was approved
by Servian public opinion.[<a id="chap0102fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
On Thursday, July 23&mdash;a month after the tragedy&mdash;Austria
suddenly delivered an ultimatum to Servia,
and demanded an acceptance of its terms within
forty-eight hours.  The demands put forward were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
harsh, humiliating, and unconscionable.  They were
such as could not have been accepted, as they stood,
by any nation which desired to preserve a shred of
its independence.  They had been framed with the
deliberate intention, either of provoking a refusal
which might afford a pretext for war, or of procuring
an acceptance which would at once reduce the Servian
Kingdom to the position of a vassal.  Even in Berlin
it was admitted[<a id="chap0102fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn2">2</a>] that this ultimatum asked more
than it was reasonable to expect Servia to yield.
But none the less, there can be but little doubt that
the German ambassador at Vienna saw and approved
the document before it was despatched, and it seems
more than likely that he had a hand in drafting it.
It also rests on good authority that the German
Kaiser was informed beforehand of the contents,
and that he did not demur to its presentation.[<a id="chap0102fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE SERVIAN REPLY
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the evening of Saturday, July 25, the Servian
Government, as required, handed in its answer.  The
purport of this, when it became known to the world,
excited surprise by the humility of its tone and the
substance of its submission.  Almost everything that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
Austria had demanded was agreed to.  What remained
outstanding was clearly not worth quarrelling
about, unless a quarrel were the object of the
ultimatum.  The refusal, such as it was, did not close
the door, but, on the contrary, contained an offer
to submit the subjects of difference to the Hague
Convention.[<a id="chap0102fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
The document was a lengthy one.  The Austrian
minister at Belgrade nevertheless found time to
read it through, to weigh it carefully, to find it
wanting, to ask for his passports, and to catch his train,
all within a period not exceeding three-quarters of
an hour from the time at which it was put into his
hands.[<a id="chap0102fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
When these occurrences became known, the
English Foreign Minister immediately made proposals
for a conference between representatives of Germany,
France, Italy, and Great Britain, with the object
of discovering some means of peaceful settlement.[<a id="chap0102fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn6">6</a>]
France and Italy promptly accepted his invitation.[<a id="chap0102fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn7">7</a>]
Germany, while professing to desire mediation, did
not accept it.[<a id="chap0102fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn8">8</a>]  Consequently Sir Edward Grey's
effort failed; and before he was able to renew it in
any more acceptable form, Austria, acting with a
promptitude almost unique in her annals, declared
war upon Servia, and hostilities began.
</p>

<p>
It is unnecessary to enter here into an examination
of the feverish and fruitless attempts to preserve
peace, which were made in various quarters during
the next four and twenty hours.  They present a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
most pathetic appearance, like the efforts of a crew,
sitting with oars unshipped, arguing, exhorting, and
imploring, while their boat drifts on to the smooth
lip of the cataract.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MOBILIZATION
</span>
</p>

<p>
Russia ordered the mobilisation of her Southern
armies, alleging that she could not stand by while
a Slav nation was being crushed out of existence,
despite the fact that it had made an abject
submission for an unproved offence.[<a id="chap0102fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, on Friday, July 31, Russia&mdash;having,
as she considered, reasons for believing that
Germany was secretly mobilising her whole
forces&mdash;proceeded to do likewise.[<a id="chap0102fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
Germany simultaneously declared 'a state of war'
within her own territories, and a veil instantly fell
upon all her internal proceedings.  She demanded
that Russia should cease her mobilisation, and as
no answer which satisfied her was forthcoming, but
only an interchange of telegrams between the two
sovereigns&mdash;disingenuous on the one side and not
unreasonably suspicious on the other&mdash;Germany
declared war on Russia on Saturday, August 1.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday and Sunday, war on a grand scale
being by this time certain, the chief interest centred
in questions of neutrality.  Germany enquired of
France whether she would undertake to stand
aside&mdash;knowing full well beforehand that the terms of the
Dual Alliance compelled the Republic to lend assistance
if Russia were attacked by more than one power.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
Sir Edward Grey enquired of France and Germany
if they would undertake to respect the integrity of
Belgium.  France replied in the affirmative.  Germany
declined to commit herself, and this was rightly
construed as a refusal.[<a id="chap0102fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
While this matter was still the subject of
diplomatic discussion the German Army advanced into
the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, and was correctly
reported as having entered Belgian territory near
Lige and French territory near Cirey.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of Sunday, August 2, the German
Government presented an ultimatum to Belgium[<a id="chap0102fn12text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn12">12</a>]
demanding free passage for its troops, thereby
putting its intentions beyond all doubt.
</p>

<p>
On the same day Italy issued a declaration of
neutrality, making it clear that, although a member
of the Triple Alliance, she did not consider herself
bound to support her allies in a war of aggression.[<a id="chap0102fn13text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Germany had been making enquiries
as to the attitude of England, and, startled to discover
that this country might not be willing tamely to
submit to the violation of Belgium and invasion of
France, proceeded to state, under cross-examination,
the price she was prepared to pay, or at any
rate to promise, for the sake of securing British
neutrality.[<a id="chap0102fn14text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ENGLAND DECLARES WAR
</span>
</p>

<p>
On Tuesday, August 4, the British Ambassador
at Berlin presented an ultimatum which demanded
an assurance, before midnight, that the integrity of
Belgium would not be violated.  The answer was
given informally at a much earlier hour by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
bombardment of Lige; and shortly before midnight
England declared war on Germany.[<a id="chap0102fn15text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
Two days later Austria declared herself to be at
war with Russia, and within a week from that date
Great Britain and France issued a similar declaration
against Austria.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0102fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0102fn1text">1</a>] There is perhaps as much reason,
certainly no more, for believing that
an official clique at Belgrade plotted
the Serajevo murders, as that an
official clique at Vienna connived at them,
by deliberately withdrawing
police protection from the unfortunate

occasion of his visit to a notorious hotbed of sedition.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
WHO WANTED WAR?
</h3>

<p>
Such is the chronological order of events; but on
the face of it, it explains little of the underlying
causes of this conflagration.  Why with the single
exception of Italy had all the great naval and military
powers of Europe, together with several smaller
nations, suddenly plunged into war?  Which of
the combatants wanted war? ... To the latter
question the answer can be given at once and with
certainty&mdash;save Germany and Austria no nation
wanted war, and even Germany and Austria did not
want <i>this</i> war.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DESIRE FOR PEACE
</span>
</p>

<p>
Whatever opinion we may entertain of the Servian
character or of her policy in recent times, it is at
all events certain that she did not desire war with
Austria.  That she submitted to the very depths of
humiliation in order to avoid war cannot be doubted
by any one who has read her reply to the demands
put forward by Vienna.  Only a few months since,
she had emerged from two sanguinary wars&mdash;the first
against Turkey and the second against Bulgaria&mdash;and
although victory had crowned her arms in both
of these contests, her losses in men and material had
been very severe.
</p>

<p>
That Russia did not desire war was equally plain.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
She was still engaged in repairing the gigantic losses
which she had sustained in her struggle with Japan.
At least two years must elapse before her new fleet
would be in a condition to take the sea, and it was
generally understood that at least as long a period
would be necessary, in order to carry through the
scheme of reorganisation by which she hoped to place
her army in a state of efficiency.  Whatever might
be the ultimate designs of Russia, it was altogether
incredible that she would have sought to bring about
a war, either at this time or in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Russia, like England, had nothing to gain by war.
Her development was proceeding rapidly.  For years
to come her highest interest must be peace.  A
supreme provocation was necessary in order to make
her draw the sword.  Such a provocation had been
given in 1909 when, ignoring the terms of the Treaty
of Berlin, Austria had formally annexed the provinces
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  But at that time
Russia's resources were not merely unprepared;
they were utterly exhausted.  Menaced simultaneously
by Vienna and Berlin, she had been forced on
that occasion to stand by, while her prestige in the
Balkan peninsula suffered a blow which she was
powerless to ward off.  Now a further encroachment
was threatened from the same quarters.  A Serb
power which looked to St. Petersburg[<a id="chap0103fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn1">1</a>] for protection
was to be put under the heel of Austria.
</p>

<p>
Nor can any one believe that France wanted war.
It is true that for a year, or rather more, after the
Agadir episode[<a id="chap0103fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn2">2</a>] the spirit of France was perturbed.
But no Foreign Office in the world&mdash;least of all that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
of Germany&mdash;was so ill-informed as to believe that
the sporadic demonstrations, which occurred in the
press and elsewhere, were caused by any eagerness
for adventure or any ambition of conquest.  They
were due, as every calm observer was aware, to one
thing and one thing only&mdash;the knowledge that the
Republic had come to the very end of her human
resources; that all her sons who were capable of
bearing arms had already been enrolled in her army;
that she could do nothing further to strengthen her
defences against Germany, who up to that time, had
taken for military training barely one half of her
available male population, and who was now engaged
in increasing her striking power both by land and sea.
The cause of this restlessness in France was the
fear that Germany was preparing an invincible
superiority and would strike so soon as her weapon was
forged.  If so, would it not be better for France to
strike at once, while she had still a fighting chance,
and before she was hopelessly outnumbered?  But
this mood, the product of anxiety and suspense,
which had been somewhat prevalent in irresponsible
quarters during the autumn of 1912 and the early
part of the following year, had passed away.  Partly
it wore itself out; partly popular interest was diverted
to other objects of excitement.
</p>

<p>
France, during the twelve months preceding
Midsummer 1914, had been singularly quiescent as
regards foreign affairs.  Her internal conditions
absorbed attention.  Various events had conspired
to disturb public confidence in the fidelity of her
rulers, and in the adequacy of their military
preparations.  The popular mood had been sobered,
disquieted, and scandalised to such a point that war,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
so far from being sought after, was the thing of all
others which France most wished to avoid.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE CASE OF BELGIUM
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is unnecessary to waste words in establishing
the aversion of Belgium from war.  There was
nothing which she could hope to gain by it in any
event.  Suffering and loss&mdash;how great suffering and
loss even Belgium herself can hardly have foreseen&mdash;were
inevitable to her civil population, as well as to
her soldiers, whether the war went well or ill.  Her
territory lay in the direct way of the invaders, and
was likely, as in times past, to become the 'cockpit
of Europe.'  She was asked to allow the free passage
of the Germanic forces.  She was promised restoration
of her independence and integrity at the end of
the war.  But to grant this arrogant demand would
have been to destroy her dynasty and wreck her
institutions; for what King or Constitution could
have withstood the popular contempt for a
government which acquiesced in national degradation?
And to believe the promise, was a thing only possible
for simpletons; for what was such an assurance
worth, seeing that, at the very moment of the offer,
Germany was engaged in breaking her former
undertaking, solemnly guaranteed and recorded, that
the neutrality of Belgium should be respected?
That the sympathies of Belgium would have been
with France in any event cannot of course be doubted;
for a French victory threatened no danger, whereas
the success of German arms was a menace to her
independence, and a prelude to vassalage or
absorption in the Empire.
</p>

<p>
Neither the British people nor their Government
wanted war.  In the end they accepted it reluctantly,
and only after most strenuous efforts had been made
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
to prevent its occurrence.  To the intelligent foreign
observer, however unfriendly, who has a thorough
understanding of British interests, ideas, and habits
of mind this is self-evident.  He does not need a
White Paper to prove it to him.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that Austria wanted war&mdash;not this war
certainly, but a snug little war with a troublesome
little neighbour, as to the outcome of which, with the
ring kept, there could be no possibility of doubt.
She obviously hoped that indirectly, and as a sort of
by-product of this convenient little war, she would
secure a great victory of the diplomatic sort over
her most powerful neighbour&mdash;a matter of infinitely
more consequence to her than the ostensible object of
her efforts.
</p>

<p>
The crushing of Servia would mean the humiliation
of Russia, and would shake, for a second time within
five years, the confidence of the Balkan peoples in
the power of the Slav Empire to protect its kindred
and co-religionists against the aggression of the
Teutons and Magyars.  Anything which would lower
the credit of Russia in the Balkan peninsula would
be a gain to Austria.  To her more ambitious
statesmen such an achievement might well seem to open
the way for coveted expansions towards the Aegean
Sea, which had been closed against her, to her great
chagrin, by the Treaty of Bucharest.[<a id="chap0103fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn3">3</a>]  To others,
whose chief anxiety was to preserve peace in their own
time, and to prevent the Austro-Hungarian State
from splitting asunder, the repression of Servia seemed
to promise security against the growing unrest and
discontent of the vast Slav population which was
included in the Empire.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
AUSTRIAN ILL-FORTUNE
</span>
</p>

<p>
For something nearer two centuries than one the
Austro-Hungarian Empire has been miscalculating
and suffering for its miscalculations, until its blunders
and ill-fortune have become a byword.  Scheming
ever for safety, Austria has never found it.  The
very modesty of her aim has helped to secure its own
defeat.  Her unvarying method has been a timid and
unimaginative repression.  In politics, as in most
other human affairs, equilibrium is more easily
attained by moving forward than by standing still.
Austria has sought security for powers, and systems,
and balances which were worn out, unsuited to our
modern world, and therefore incapable of being
secured at all.  The more she has schemed for safety
the more precarious her integrity has become.  There
are things which scheming will never accomplish&mdash;things
which for their achievement need a change of
spirit, some new birth of faith or freedom.  But in
Vienna change in any direction is ill-regarded, and
new births are ever more likely to be strangled in
their cradles than to arrive at maturity.
</p>

<p>
Distracted by the problem of her divers, discordant,
and unwelded[<a id="chap0103fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn4">4</a>] races, Austria has always inclined to
put her trust in schemers who were able to produce
some plausible system, some ingenious device, some
promising ladder of calculation, or miscalculation, for
reaching the moon without going through the clouds.
In the present case there can be no doubt that she
allowed herself to be persuaded by her German
neighbours that Russia was not in a position to make
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
an effective fight, and would therefore probably stand
by, growling and showing her teeth.  Consequently
it was safe to take a bold line; to present Servia
with an ultimatum which had been made completely
watertight against acceptance of the unconditional
and immediate kind; to reject any acceptance which
was not unconditional and immediate; to allow the
Government of King Peter no time for second thoughts,
the European Powers no time for mediation, her own
Minister at Belgrade time only to give one hasty
glance at the reply, call for his passports, and catch
his train.  So far as poor humanity can make certain
of anything, Austria, with German approval and
under German guidance, made certain of war with
Servia.
</p>

<p>
But the impression produced, when this matter
first began to excite public attention, was somewhat
different.  Foreign newspaper correspondents at
Vienna and Berlin were specially well cared for after
the Serajevo murders, and when the ultimatum was
delivered, they immediately sent to England and
elsewhere accounts of the position which made it
appear, that the Austrian Government and people,
provoked beyond endurance by the intrigues of
Servia, had acted impetuously, possibly unwisely,
but not altogether inexcusably.
</p>

<p>
At this stage the idea was also sedulously put
about that the Kaiser was behaving like a gentleman.
It was suggested that Germany had been left very
much in the dark until the explosion actually occurred,
and that she was now paying the penalty of loyalty
to an indiscreet friend, by suffering herself to be
dragged into a quarrel in which she had neither
interest nor concern.  In these early days, when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
Sir Edward Grey was striving hopefully, if
somewhat innocently, after peace, it was assumed by
the world in general, that Germany, for her own
reasons, must desire, at least as ardently as the British
Foreign Minister, to find a means of escape from an
exceedingly awkward position, and that she would
accordingly use her great influence with her ally to
this end.  If there had been a grain of truth in this
assumption, peace would have been assured, for
France and Italy had already promised their support.
But this theory broke down very speedily; and as
soon as the official papers were published, it was
seen never to have rested on the smallest basis of
fact.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMANY USES AUSTRIA
</span>
</p>

<p>
So far from Germany having been dragged in
against her will, it was clear that from the beginning
she had been using Austria as an agent, who was
not unwilling to stir up strife, but was only
half-conscious of the nature and dimensions of the contest
which was bound to follow.  It is not credible that
Germany was blind to the all-but-inevitable results
of letting Austria loose to range around, of hallooing
her on, and of comforting her with assurances of loyal
support.  But it may well be believed that Austria
herself did not see the situation in the same clear
light, and remained almost up to the last, under the
delusion, which had been so industriously fostered
by the German ambassador at Vienna, that Russia
could not fight effectively and therefore would
probably choose not to fight at all.
</p>

<p>
But although Austria may have had no adequate
conception of the consequences which her action
would bring about, it is certain that Germany
foresaw them, with the single exception of British
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
intervention; that what she foresaw she also desired; and
further, that at the right moment she did her part,
boldly but clumsily, to guard against any miscarriage
of her schemes.
</p>

<p>
Germany continued to make light of all apprehensions
of serious danger from St. Petersburg;
but at the eleventh hour Austria appears suddenly
to have realised for herself the appalling nature
of the catastrophe which impended.  Something
happened; what it was we do not know, and the
present generation will probably never know.  We
may conjecture, however&mdash;but it is only conjecture&mdash;that
by some means or other the intrigues of
the war cabal at Vienna&mdash;the instrument of German
policy, owing more fealty to the Kaiser than to
their own Emperor&mdash;had been unmasked.  In hot
haste they were disavowed, and Austria opened
discussions with Russia 'in a perfectly friendly
manner,'[<a id="chap0103fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn5">5</a>] and with good hopes of success, as to how
the catastrophe might still be averted.
</p>

<p>
On Thursday, July 30, we are informed, the
tension between Vienna and St. Petersburg had
greatly relaxed.  An arrangement compatible with
the honour and interests of both empires seemed
almost in sight when, on the following day, Germany
suddenly intervened with ultimatums to France and
Russia, of a kind to which only one answer was
possible.  The spirit of the Ems telegram[<a id="chap0103fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn6">6</a>] had
inebriated a duller generation.  "A few days' delay,"
our Ambassador at Vienna concludes, "might in all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
probability have saved Europe from one of the
greatest calamities in history."[<a id="chap0103fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
SIR EDWARD GREY
</span>
</p>

<p>
As we turn over the official pages in which the
British Government has set out its case, we are
inclined to marvel&mdash;knowing what we now know&mdash;that
our Foreign Minister should have shown so
much zeal and innocence in pleading the cause of
peace on high grounds of humanity, and with a faith,
apparently unshaken to the last, that in principle
at least, the German Government were in full
agreement with his aims.  The practical disadvantages
of being a gentleman are that they are apt to make
a man too credulous and not sufficiently inquisitive.
Sir Edward Grey acted according to his nature.
His miscalculation was one which his fellow-countrymen
have not hesitated to forgive.  But clearly he
misjudged the forces which were opposed to him.
He was deceived by hollow assurances.  He beat
hopefully, but vainly and pathetically, against a
door which was already barred and bolted, and
behind which (could he but have seen) the Kaiser,
with his Ministers and Staff, was wholly absorbed in
the study of war maps and tables of mobilisation.
</p>

<p>
Sir Edward Grey failed to prevent war, and in
the circumstances it is hardly to be wondered at.
But if he failed in one direction he succeeded in
another.  His whole procedure from first to last
was so transparently disinterested and above board
that, when war did actually come upon us, it found
us, not merely as a nation, but also as an Empire,
more united than we have ever been at any crisis,
since the Great Armada was sighted off Plymouth
Sound.  English people felt that whatever else there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
might be to reproach themselves with, they at any
rate went into the fight with clean hands.  What is
even more remarkable, the people of all neutral
countries, with the possible exception of the rigid
moralists of Constantinople, appeared for once to
share the same opinion.
</p>

<p>
This was a great achievement; nearly, but not
quite, the greatest of all.  To have prevented war
would have been a greater achievement still....
But was war inevitable?  Or was M. Sazonof right,
when he said to our Ambassador, on the morning of
the day when Servia replied to the Austrian
ultimatum,[<a id="chap0103fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn8">8</a>] that if Britain then took her stand firmly
with France and Russia there would be no war; but
that if we failed them then, rivers of blood would
flow, and in the end we should be dragged into war?[<a id="chap0103fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
Sir Edward Grey refused to take this course.  He
judged that a pronouncement of such a character
would appear in the light of a menace to the
governments of Germany and Austria, and also to public
opinion in those countries; that it would only stiffen
their backs; that a more hopeful way of proceeding
was for England to deal with Germany as a friend,
letting it be understood that if our counsels of
moderation were disregarded, we might be driven most
reluctantly into the camp of her enemies.  To this,
when it was urged by our Ambassador at St. Petersburg,
the Russian Minister only replied&mdash;and the
words seem to have in them a note of tragedy and
weariness, as if the speaker well knew that he was
talking to deaf ears&mdash;that unfortunately Germany
was convinced that she could count upon the neutrality
of Britain.[<a id="chap0103fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
</p>

<p>
The alternative was to speak out as Mr. Lloyd
George spoke at the time of the Agadir crisis, 'to
rattle the sabre,' and to take our stand 'in shining
armour' beside the other two members of the Entente.
</p>

<p>
Sir Edward Grey believed that this procedure would
not have the effect desired, but the reverse.  Further,
it would have committed this country to a policy
which had never been submitted to it, and which it
had never considered, far less approved, even in
principle.  The Agadir precedent could be
distinguished.  There the danger which threatened
France arose directly out of treaty engagements
with ourselves.  Here there was no such particular
justification, but a wide general question of the safety
of Europe and the British Empire.
</p>

<p>
With regard to this wider question, notwithstanding
its imminence for a good many years, the British
Empire had not made up its mind, nor indeed had
it ever been asked to do so by those in authority.
Sir Edward Grey appears to have thought that, on
democratic principles, he had not the right to make
such a pronouncement as M. Sazonof desired; and
that even if this pathway might have led to peace, it
was one which he could not tread.
</p>

<p>
The one alternative was tried, and failed.  We
proffered our good offices, we urged our counsels of
moderation, all in vain.  That, at any rate, is among
the certainties.  And it is also among the certainties
that, although this alternative failed, it brought us
two signal benefits, in the unity of our own people and
the goodwill of the world.
</p>

<p>
About the other alternative, which was not tried,
we cannot of course speak with the same sureness.
If Sir Edward Grey had taken the step which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
M. Sazonof desired him to take, he would at once have
been vehemently opposed and denounced by a very
large body of his own fellow-countrymen, who, never
having been taken frankly into the confidence of
the Government with regard to the foundations of
British policy, were at this early stage of the
proceedings almost wholly ignorant of the motives and
issues involved.  This being so, if war had ensued,
we should then have gone into it a divided instead
of a united nation.  On the other hand, if peace had
ensued, it must have been a patched-up ill-natured
peace; and it is not improbable that Sir Edward
Grey would have been driven from office by enemies
in his own household, playing the game of Germany
unconsciously, as on previous occasions, and would
have brought the Cabinet down with him in his fall.
For at this time, owing to domestic difficulties, the
Government stood in a very perilous position, and it
needed only such a mutiny, as a bold departure in
foreign affairs would almost certainly have provoked
among the Liberal party, to bring Mr. Asquith's
government to an end.
</p>

<p>
As one reads and re-reads the official documents
in our present twilight, it is difficult to resist the
conclusion that on the main point Sir Edward Grey
was wrong and M. Sazonof right.  Germany, with
her eyes wide open, had determined on war with
Russia and France, unless by Russia's surrender of
her prestige in the Balkans&mdash;a surrender in its way
almost as abject as that which had already been
demanded of Servia&mdash;the results of victory could be
secured without recourse to arms.  Germany,
nevertheless, was not prepared for war with Britain.  She
was reckoning with confidence on our standing aside,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
on our unwillingness and inability to intervene.[<a id="chap0103fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn11">11</a>]  If it
had been made clear to her, that in case she insisted
on pressing things to extremity, we should on no
account stand aside, she might then have eagerly
forwarded, instead of deliberately frustrating,
Austria's eleventh-hour negotiations for an
accommodation with St. Petersburg.
</p>

<p>
No one, except Germans, whose judgments, naturally
enough, are disordered by the miscarriage of
their plans, has dreamed of bringing the charge
against Sir Edward Grey that he wished for war, or
fomented it, or even that through levity or want of
vigilance, he allowed it to occur.  The criticism is,
that although his intentions were of the best, and
his industry unflagging, he failed to realise the
situation, and to adopt the only means which might
have secured peace.
</p>

<p>
The charge which is not only alleged, but established
against Austria is of a wholly different order.
It is that she provoked war&mdash;blindly perhaps, and
not foreseeing what the war would be, but at any
rate recklessly and obstinately.
</p>

<p>
The crime of which Germany stands accused is
that she deliberately aimed at war, and that when
there seemed a chance of her plan miscarrying, she
promptly took steps to render peace impossible.
Among neutral countries is there one, the public
opinion of which has acquitted her?  And has not
Italy, her own ally, condemned her by refusing
assistance on the ground that this war is a war of
German aggression?

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
THE PENALTY OF NEGLIGENCE
</h3>

<p>
The East has been drawn into the circle of this
war as well as the West, the New World as well as
the Old; nor can any man feel certain, or even
hopeful, that the conflagration will be content to
burn itself out where it is now raging, and will not
spread across further boundaries....  It is therefore
no matter of surprise that people should be asking
themselves&mdash;"Of what nature is this war?  Is it
one of those calamities, like earthquake or tempest,
drought or flood, which lawyers describe as 'the
act of God'?  Or is it a thing which, having been
conceived and deliberately projected by the wit of
man, could have been averted by human courage
and judgment?  Was this war, or was it not,
inevitable?" ... To which it may be answered, that
no war is inevitable until it occurs; and then every
war is apt to make pretensions to that character.
</p>

<p>
In old times it was the Fates, superior even to
Zeus, who decreed wars.  In later days wars were
regarded as the will of God.  And to-day professional
interpreters of events are as ready as ever with
explanations why this war was, in the nature of things,
unavoidable.  Whether the prevailing priesthood
wears white robes and fillets, or rich vestments, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
cassocks and Geneva bands, or the severer modern
garb of the professor or politician, it appears to be
equally prone to dogmatic blasphemy.  There is no
proof that this war was pre-ordained either by a
Christian God or by the laws of Pagan Nature.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
WAS WAR INEVITABLE?
</span>
</p>

<p>
One may doubt if any war is inevitable.  If
statesmen can gain time the chances are that they
will gain peace.  This was the view of public opinion
throughout the British Empire down to July 1914.
It was in a special sense the view of the Liberal party;
and their view was endorsed, if not by the whole body
of Unionists, at any rate by their leader, in terms which
admitted of no misunderstanding.[<a id="chap0104fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0104fn1">1</a>]  It is also the point
of view from which this book is written....  This
war was not inevitable; it could have been avoided,
but on one condition&mdash;<i>if England had been prepared</i>.
</p>

<p>
England was not prepared either morally or
materially.  Her rulers had left her in the dark as
to the dangers which surrounded her.  They had
neglected to make clear to her&mdash;probably even to
themselves&mdash;the essential principles of British policy,
and the sacrifices which it entailed.  They had
failed to provide armaments to correspond with
this policy.  When the crisis arose their hands
were tied.  They had to sit down hurriedly, and
decipher their policy, and find out what it meant.
Still more hurriedly they had to get it approved,
not merely by their fellow-countrymen, but by their
own colleagues&mdash;a work, if rumour[<a id="chap0104fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0104fn2">2</a>] speaks truly, of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
considerable difficulty.  Then they found that one
of the main supports was wanting; and they had
to set to work frantically to make an army adequate
to their needs.
</p>

<p>
But it was too late.  By this time their policy
had fallen about their ears in ruins.  For their policy
was the neutrality of Belgium, and that was already
violated.  Their policy was the defence of France,
and invasion had begun.  Their policy was peace,
and peace was broken.  The nation which would enjoy
peace must be strong enough to enforce peace.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The moods of nations pass like clouds, only more
slowly.  They bank up filled with menace; we
look again and are surprised to find that they have
melted away as silently and swiftly as they came.
One does not need to be very old to recall various
wars, deemed at one time or another to be inevitable,
which never occurred.  In the 'sixties' war with the
second Empire was judged to be inevitable; and along
our coasts dismantled forts remain to this day as
monuments of our fathers' firm belief in the imminence
of an invasion.  In the 'seventies,' and indeed until
we had entered the present century, war with Russia
was regarded as inevitable by a large number of
well-informed people; and for a part of this period
war with the French Republic was judged to be no
less so.  Fortune on the whole was favourable.
Circumstances changed.  The sense of a common
danger healed old antagonisms.  Causes of chronic
irritation disappeared of themselves, or were removed
by diplomatic surgery.  And with the disappearance
of these inflammatory centres, misunderstandings,
prejudices, and suspicions began to vanish also.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
Gradually it became clear, that what had been
mistaken on both sides for destiny was nothing more
inexorable than a fit of temper, or a conflict of
business interests not incapable of adjustment.  And
in a sense the German menace was less formidable
than any of these others, for the reason that it was
a fit of temper on one side only&mdash;a fit of temper, or
megalomania.  We became fully conscious of the
German mood only after the end of the South African
War, when its persistence showed clearly that it arose,
not from any sympathy with the Dutch, but from some
internal cause.  When this cause was explained to us
it seemed so inadequate, so absurd, so unreal, so
contrary to the facts, that only a small fraction of our
nation ever succeeded in believing that it actually
existed.  We had been taught by Carlyle, that while
the verities draw immortal life from the facts to
which they correspond, the falsities have but a
phenomenal existence, and a brief influence over
the minds of men.  Consequently the greater part
of the British people troubled their heads very little
about this matter, never thought things would come
to a crisis, or lead to serious mischief; but trusted
always that, in due time, the ridiculous illusions of
our neighbours would vanish and die of their own
inanity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN JEALOUSY
</span>
</p>

<p>
We listened with an equal wonder and weariness
to German complaints that we were jealous of her
trade and bent on strangling it; that we grudged
her colonial expansion, and were intriguing all the
world over to prevent it; that we had isolated her
and ringed her round with hostile alliances.  We
knew that these notions were all entirely false.  We
knew that, so far from hampering German commerce,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
our Free Trade system in the United Kingdom, in
the Dependencies, and in the Indian Empire had
fostered it and helped its rapid and brilliant success
more than any other external factor.
</p>

<p>
For fully thirty years from 1870&mdash;during which
period what remained of the uncivilised portions of
the world was divided up, during which period also
Germany was the most powerful nation in Europe,
and could have had anything she wanted of these
new territories almost for the asking&mdash;Bismarck and
the statesmen of his school, engrossed mainly in the
European situation, set little store by colonies,
thought of them rather as expensive and dangerous
vanities, and abstained deliberately from taking an
energetic part in the scramble.  We knew, that in Africa
and the East, Germany had nevertheless obtained
considerable possessions, and that it was, primarily
her own fault that she had not obtained more.  We
assumed, no doubt very foolishly, that she must
ultimately become aware of her absurdity in blaming
us for her own neglect.  We forgot human nature,
and the apologue of the drunkard who cursed the
lamp-post for its clumsiness in getting in his way.
</p>

<p>
The British people knew that Germany was
talking nonsense; but unfortunately they never fully
realised that she was sincere, and meant all the
things she said.  They thought she only half believed
in her complaints, as a man is apt to do when
ill-temper upsets his equanimity.  They were confident
that in the end the falsities would perish and the
verities remain, and that in the fulness of time the
two nations would become friends.
</p>

<p>
As to this last the British people probably judged
correctly; but they entirely overlooked the fact,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
that if truth was to be given a chance of prevailing
in the end, it was important to provide against
mischief which might very easily occur in the meantime.
Nor did their rulers, whose duty it was, ever
warn them seriously of this necessity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DANGERS OF ILL-TEMPER
</span>
</p>

<p>
When a man works himself up into a rage and
proceeds to flourish a loaded revolver, something
more is necessary for the security of the bystanders
than the knowledge that his ill-temper does not
rest upon a reasonable basis.  War was not
inevitable, certainly; but until the mood of Germany
changed, it was exceedingly likely to occur unless
the odds against the aggressor were made too
formidable for him to face.  None of the governments,
however, which have controlled our national destinies
since 1900, ever developed sufficient energy to realise
the position of affairs, or ever mustered up courage
to tell the people clearly what the risks were, to state
the amount of the premium which was required to
cover the risks, and to insist upon the immediate
duty of the sacrifice which imperial security
inexorably demanded.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
</h3>

<p>
Although in a technical sense the present war was
brought on by Austrian diplomacy, no one, in England
at least, is inclined to rate the moral responsibility
of that empire at the highest figure.  It is in
Germany that we find, or imagine ourselves to have
found, not only the true and deep-seated causes of
the war, but the immediate occasions of it.
</p>

<p>
Not the least of our difficulties, however, is to
decide the point&mdash;Who is Germany?  Who was
her man of business?  Who acted for her in the
matter of this war?  Who pulled the wires, or
touched the button that set the conflagration blazing?
Was this the work of an individual or a camarilla?
Was it the result of one strong will prevailing, or of
several wills getting to loggerheads&mdash;wills not
particularly strong, but obstinate, and flustered by internal
controversy and external events?  What actually
happened&mdash;was it meant by the 'super-men' to
happen, or did it come as a shock&mdash;not upon
'supermen' at all&mdash;but upon several groups of surprised
blunderers?  These questions are not likely to be
answered for a generation or more&mdash;until, if ever,
the archives of Vienna and Berlin give up their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
secrets&mdash;and it would therefore be idle to waste too
much time in analysis of the probabilities.
</p>

<p>
The immediate occasion of the catastrophe has
been variously attributed to the German court, army,
bureaucracy, professors, press, and people.  If we are
looking only for a single thing&mdash;the hand which lit the
conflagration&mdash;and not for the profounder and more
permanent causes and origins of the trouble, we can at
once dismiss several of these suspects from the dock.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MEN OF LETTERS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Men of learning and letters, professors of every
variety&mdash;a class which has been christened 'the
Pedantocracy' by unfriendly critics&mdash;may be all
struck off the charge-sheet as unconcerned in the
actual delinquency of arson.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if not in name, these are a kind of priesthood,
and a large part of their lives' work has been
to spread among German youth the worship of the
State under Hohenzollern kingship.  It is impossible
of course to make 'a silk purse out of a sow's ear,'
a religion out of a self-advertising dynasty, or a god
out of a machine.  Consequently, except for mischief,
their efforts have been mainly wasted.  Over a long
period of years, however, they have been engaged in
heaping up combustibles.  They have filled men's
minds to overflowing with notions which are very
liable to lead to war, and which indeed were designed
for no other purpose than to prepare public opinion
for just such a war as this.  Their responsibility
therefore is no light one, and it will be dealt with
later.  But they are innocent at all events of
complicity in this particular exploit of fire-raising; and
if, after the event, they have sought to excuse,
vindicate, and uphold the action of their rulers it would
be hard measure to condemn them for that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
</p>

<p>
Nor did the press bring about the war.  In other
countries, where the press is free and irresponsible, it
has frequently been the prime mover in such mischief;
but never in Germany.  For in Germany the press is
incapable of bringing about anything of the political
kind, being merely an instrument and not a principal.
</p>

<p>
Just as little can the charge of having produced
the war be brought against the people.  In other
countries, where the people are used to give marching
orders to their rulers, popular clamour has led to
catastrophe of this kind more frequently than any
other cause.  But this, again, has never been so in
Germany.  The German people are sober, steadfast,
and humble in matters of high policy.  They have
confidence in their rulers, believe what they are told,
obey orders readily, but do not think of giving them.
When war was declared, all Germans responded to the
call of duty with loyalty and devotion.  Nay, having
been prepared for at least a generation, they welcomed
war with enthusiasm.  According to the lights which
were given them to judge by, they judged every whit
as rightly as our own people.  The lights were false
lights, hung out deliberately to mislead them and to
justify imperial policy.  But this was no fault of
theirs.  Moreover, the judgment which they came
to with regard to the war was made after the event,
and cannot therefore in any case be held responsible
for its occurrence.  This is a people's war surely
enough, but just as surely, the people had no hand
in bringing it about.
</p>

<p>
The circle of the accused is therefore narrowed
down to the Court, the Army, and the Bureaucracy.
And there we must leave it for the present&mdash;a joint
indictment against all three.  But whether these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
parties were guilty, all three in equal measure, we
cannot conjecture with the least approach to certainty.
Nor can we even say precisely of what they were
guilty&mdash;of misunderstanding&mdash;of a quarrel among
themselves&mdash;of a series of blunders&mdash;or of a crime so
black and deliberate, that no apologist will be able
ever to delete it from the pages of history.  On all
this posterity must be left to pronounce.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN MILITARY OPINION
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is only human nevertheless to be curious about
personalities.  Unfortunately for the satisfaction of
this appetite, all is darkness as to the German Army.
We may suspect that the Prussian junker, or country
gentleman, controls and dominates it.  But even as
to this we may conceivably be wrong.  The military
genius of some Hanoverian, Saxon, or Bavarian
may possess the mastery in council.  As to the real
heads of the army, as to their individual characters,
and their potency in directing policy we know nothing
at all.  After nine months of war, we have arrived
at no clear notion, even with regard to their relative
values as soldiers in the field.  We have even less
knowledge as to their influence beforehand in shaping
and deciding the issues of war and peace.
</p>

<p>
This much, however, we may reasonably deduce
from Bernhardi and other writers&mdash;that military
opinion had been anxious for some considerable
number of years past, and more particularly since
the Agadir incident,[<a id="chap0105fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0105fn1">1</a>] lest war, which it regarded as
ultimately inevitable, should be delayed until the
forces ranged against Germany, especially upon her
Eastern frontier, were too strong for her to cope with.
</p>

<p>
In the pages of various official publications, and
in newspaper reports immediately before and after
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
war began, we caught glimpses of certain characters
at work; but these were not professional soldiers;
they were members of the Court and the Bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Imperial Chancellor,
comes upon the scene&mdash;a harassed and indignant
official&mdash;sorely flustered&mdash;not by any means master
of his temper&mdash;not altogether certain of his
facts&mdash;in considerable doubt apparently as to whether
things have not passed behind his back which he
ought to have been told of by higher powers, but
was not.  He appears to us as a diligent and faithful
servant,&mdash;one who does not seek to impose his own
decisions, but to excuse, justify, and carry out,
if he can, decisions which have been made by others,
more highly placed and greedier of responsibility
than himself.
</p>

<p>
Herr von Jagow, the Foreign Minister, is much
affected.  He drops tears&mdash;or comes somewhere near
dropping them&mdash;over the lost hopes of a peaceful
understanding between England and Germany.  We
can credit the sincerity of his sorrow all the more
easily, for the reason that Herr von Jagow behaves
throughout the crisis as the courteous gentleman;
while others, who by position were even greater
gentlemen, forget momentarily, in their excitement,
the qualities which are usually associated with that
title.
</p>

<p>
Then there is the German Ambassador at
Vienna&mdash;obviously a firebrand&mdash;enjoying, one imagines,
the confidence of the war parties in both capitals:
also apparently a busy intriguer.  The documents
show him acting behind the back of the Berlin Foreign
Office, and communicating direct with the Kaiser.
</p>

<p>
We gather very clearly that he egged on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
statesmen of Vienna, with great diligence and success,
to press Servia to extremes, and to shear time so
short that peace-makers had nothing left to catch
hold of.  Russia, he assured them, would never
carry her opposition to the point of war.  Even if
she did so, he argued with much plausibility, she
would be negligible.  For she stood midway in a
great military and naval reformation, than which
no situation is more deplorable for the purposes of
carrying on a campaign.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
PRINCE LICHNOWSKY
</span>
</p>

<p>
When Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador
in London, took his departure at the outbreak
of war, he probably left no single enemy behind him.
A simple, friendly, sanguine figure, with a pardonable
vanity which led him to believe the incredible.  He
produced what is called in the cant of the day 'an
atmosphere,' mainly in drawing-rooms and newspaper
offices, but occasionally, one conjectures, even in
Downing Street itself.  His artistry was purely in
air and touched nothing solid.  He was useful to
his employers, mainly because he put England off
her guard.  He would not have been in the least
useful if he had not been mainly sincere.
</p>

<p>
But though he was useful to German policy, he
was not trusted by the powers in Berlin to attend to
their business at the Court of St. James's except
under strict supervision.  What precisely were the
duties of Baron von Kuhlmann, Councillor to the
Embassy?  He was always very cheerful, and obliging,
and ready to smooth any little difficulty out
of the way.  On the other hand, he was also very
deft at inserting an obstacle with an air of perfect
innocence, which imposed on nearly every one&mdash;even
occasionally on the editors of newspapers.  For
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
some reason, however, very few people were willing
to accept this plausible diplomatist's assurances
without a grain or two of salt.  Indeed quite a large
number were so misled by their prejudices against
him, that they were convinced his prime vocation
was that of a spy&mdash;a spy on the country to which he
was accredited and on the Ambassador under whom
he served.[<a id="chap0105fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0105fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
We know more of the Kaiser than of any of these
others, and we have known him over a much longer
period.  And yet our knowledge of him has never
enabled us to forecast his actions with any certainty.
British ministers and diplomatists, whose business it
is to gauge, not only the muzzle-velocity of eminent
characters, but also the forces of their recoil, never
seem to have arrived at any definite conclusions with
regard to this baffling personality.  Whatever he
did or did not do, they were always surprised by it,
which gives us some measure of their capacity if not
of his.
</p>

<p>
The Kaiser is pre-eminently a man of moods.
At one time he is Henry the Fifth, at another Richard
the Second.  Upon occasions he appears as Hamlet,
cursing fate which impels him to make a decision.
Within the same hour he is Autolycus crying up his
wares with an unfeigned cheerfulness.  He is possessed
by the demon of quick-change and restlessness.  We
learn on good authority that he possesses an almost
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
incredible number of uniforms which he actually
wears, and of royal residences which he occasionally
inhabits.  He clothes himself suitably for each brief
occasion, and sleeps rarely, if reports can be believed,
for more than two nights together under the same
roof.  He is like an American millionaire in his
fondness for rapid and sudden journeys, and like a
democratic politician in his passion for speech-making.
</p>

<p>
The phenomena of the moment&mdash;those which
flicker upon the surface of things&mdash;engage his eager
and vivacious interest.  Upon such matters his
commentaries are often apt and entertaining.  But
when he attempts to deal with deeper issues, and with
the underlying principles and causes of human action,
his utterances immediately lose the mind's attention
and keep hold only of the ear's, by virtue of a certain
resonance and blatancy.  When the Kaiser discourses
to us, as he often does, upon the profundities of
politics, philosophy, and religion, he falls instantly into
set forms, which express nothing that is living and
real.  He would have the world believe, and doubtless
himself sincerely believes, that he has plunged, like
a pearl-diver, into the deeps, and has returned thence
laden with rich treasures of thought and experience.
But in truth he has never visited this region at all,
being of a nature far too buoyant for such enterprises.
He has not found truth, but only remembered phrases.
</p>

<p>
The Kaiser is frequently upbraided for his charm
of manner by people who have come under its influence
and been misled.  One of the commonest accusations
against him is that of duplicity; but indeed it
seems hardly more just to condemn him for duplicity
than it would be to praise him for sincerity.  He is
a man dangerous to have dealings with, but this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
is owing to the irresponsible effervescence of his
ideas.  At any given moment he probably means
the greater part of what he says; but the image
of one moment is swiftly expelled and obliterated
by that of the next.  The Kaiser's untrustworthiness
arises not from duplicity, so much as from the
quickness of his fancy, the shallowness of his judgment,
and the shortness of his memory.  That his
communications frequently produce the same effects as
duplicity, is due to the fact that he recognises no
obligation either to stand by his word, or to correct
the impression which his hasty assurances may have
produced in the mind of his interlocutor.  The
statesman who is won over to-day by his advocacy
of an English alliance, is astounded on the morrow
to find him encouraging an English pogrom.[<a id="chap0105fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0105fn3">3</a>]

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE IDEA OF ANTICHRIST
</span>
</p>

<p>
When a violent convulsion shakes the world
people immediately begin to look about them for some
mighty and malevolent character who can be held
responsible for it.  To the generations which knew
them, Cromwell, Napoleon, and Bismarck all figured
as Antichrist.  But in regard to the policy which
produced the present war, of what man can it be said
truly, either that he controlled that policy, or that he
brought about the results which he aimed at?  Which
of the great personages concerned possesses the
sublime qualities of the spirit of evil?[<a id="chap0105fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0105fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
It is conceivable, though very unlikely, that
behind the scenes there was some strong silent man
who worked the others like puppets on a string; but
among those who have made themselves known to
us in the pages of White Papers and the like, there
is none whose features bear the least resemblance
to our conception of Antichrist; none who had firm
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
control of events, or even of himself.  There is none
of whom it is possible to say truly that he achieved
the results at which he aimed.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that the war which the joint efforts
of these great personages brought into existence was
a monstrous birth, and that it filled those who were
responsible for it with dismay, only a degree less
than it shocked other people.  For proof of this, it
is unnecessary to look further than the miscalculations
of the political kind which became recognised for
such within a few weeks after war was declared.

Just as man is endowed with a duality of certain

two separate Foreign
Office departments, etc., etc.

as if his features had
been frozen into this dramatically
appropriate expression&mdash;following

was <i>Vater Fritz</i>,&mdash;Father Fred,&mdash;a
name of familiarity which had not
bred contempt in that instance.  He is
a King every inch of him, though
without the trappings of a King.

CHAPTER VI
<br />
GERMAN MISCALCULATIONS
</h3>

<p>
In the world's play-house there are a number of
prominent and well-placed seats, which the instinct
of veneration among mankind insists on reserving
for Super-men; and as mankind is never content
unless the seats of the super-men are well filled, 'the
Management'&mdash;in other words, the press, the publicists,
and other manipulators of opinion&mdash;have to
do the best they can to find super-men to sit in them.
When that is impossible, it is customary to burnish
up, fig out, and pass off various colourable substitutes
whom it is thought, may be trusted to comport
themselves with propriety until the curtain falls.  But
those resplendent creatures whom we know so well
by sight and fame, and upon whom all eyes and
opera-glasses are directed during the <i>entr'-actes</i>, are
for the most part not super-men at all, but merely
what, in the slang of the box-office, is known as
'paper.'  Indeed there have been long periods, even
generations, during which the supposed super-men
have been wholly 'paper.'
</p>

<p>
Of course so long as the super-men substitutes
have only to walk to their places, to bow, smile,
frown, overawe, and be admired, everything goes
safely enough.  The audience is satisfied and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
'management' rubs its hands.  But if anything has
to be done beyond this parade business, if the
unexpected happens, if, for instance, there is an alarm
of fire&mdash;in which case the example set by the
super-creatures might be of inestimable assistance&mdash;the
'paper' element is certain to crumple up, according
to the laws of its nature, being after all but dried pulp.
Something of this kind appears to have happened
in various great countries during the weeks which
immediately preceded and followed the outbreak of
war, and in none was the crumpling up of the
supermen substitutes more noticeable than in Germany.
</p>

<p>
The thoroughness of the German race is no empty
boast.  All the world knows as much by experience
in peace as well as war.  Consequently, people had
said to themselves: "However it may be with other
nations, in Germany at all events the strings of
foreign policy are firmly held in giant fingers."  But
as day succeeded day, unmasking one miscalculation
after another, it became clear that there must
have been at least as much 'paper' in the political
high places of Germany as elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, although this war was made in Germany,
it did not at all follow the course which had been
charted for it in the official forecasts.  For the
German bureaucracy and general staff had laid their
plans to crush France at the first onset&mdash;to crush her
till the bones stuck out through her skin.  And they
had reckoned to out-general Russia and roll back her
multitudes, as yet unorganised&mdash;so at least it was
conceived&mdash;in wave upon wave of encroaching defeat.
</p>

<p>
Having achieved these aims before the fall of the
leaf, Germany would have gained thereby another
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
decade for the undisturbed development of wealth
and world-power.  Under Prussian direction the
power of Austria would then be consolidated within
her own dominions and throughout the Balkan
Peninsula.  At the end of this interval of vigorous
recuperation, or possibly earlier, Germany would
attack England, and England would fall an easy prey.
For having stood aside from the former struggle she
would be without allies.  Her name would stink in
the nostrils of Russia and France; and indeed to the
whole world she would be recognised for what she
was&mdash;a decadent and coward nation.  Even her
own children would blush for her dishonour.
</p>

<p>
That these were the main lines of the German
forecast no man can doubt, who has watched and
studied the development of events; and although
it is as yet too early days to make sure that nothing
of all this vast conception will ever be realised, much
of it&mdash;the time-table at all events&mdash;has certainly
miscarried for good and all.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE TIME-TABLE MISCARRIES
</span>
</p>

<p>
According to German calculations England would
stand aside; but England took part.  Italy would
help her allies; but Italy refused.  Servia was a
thing of naught; but Servia destroyed several army
corps.  Belgium would not count; and yet Belgium
by her exertions counted, if for nothing more, for the
loss of eight precious days, while by her sufferings
she mobilised against the aggressor the condemnation
of the whole world.
</p>

<p>
The Germans reckoned that the army of France
was terrible only upon paper.  Forty-five years of
corrupt government and political peculation must,
according to their calculations, have paralysed the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
general staff and betrayed the national spirit.  The
sums voted for equipment, arms, and ammunition
must assuredly have been spirited away, as under
The Third Empire, into the pockets of ministers,
senators, deputies, and contractors.  The results of
this rgime would become apparent, as they had done
in 1870, only in the present case sooner.
</p>

<p>
War was declared by the Third Napoleon at
mid-July, by William the Second not until August
1; but Sedan or its equivalent would occur,
nevertheless, in the first days of September, in 1914 as in
1870.  In the former contest Paris fell at the end of
six months; in this one, with the aid of howitzers, it
would fall at the end of six weeks.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for this confident prediction,
whatever may have been the deficiency in the French
supplies, however dangerous the consequent hitches
in mobilisation, things fell out quite differently.
The spirit of the people of France, and the devotion
of her soldiers, survived the misfeasances of the
politicians, supposing indeed that such crimes had
actually been committed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a feature of Bismarck's diplomacy that
he put a high value upon the good opinion of
the world, and took the greatest pains to avoid its
condemnation.  In 1870, as we now know, he schemed
successfully, to lure the government of Napoleon the
Third into a declaration of war, thereby saddling the
French government with the odium which attaches to
peace-breakers.[<a id="chap0106fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0106fn1">1</a>]  But in the case of the present war,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
which, as it out-Bismarcked Bismarck in deliberate
aggressiveness, stood all the more in need of a tactful
introduction to the outside world, the precautions
of that astute statesman were neglected or despised.
From the beginning all neutral nations were resentful
of German procedure, and after the devastation of
Belgium and the destruction of Louvain, the spacious
morality of the Young Turks alone was equal to the
profession of friendship and admiration.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
CRUELTIES IN BELGIUM
</span>
</p>

<p>
The objects which Germany sought to gain by the
cruelties perpetrated, under orders, by her soldiers in
Belgium and Northern France are clear enough.
These objects were certainly of considerable value in a
military as well as in a political sense.  One wonders,
however, if even Germany herself now considers them
to have been worth the abhorrence and disgust which
they have earned for her throughout the civilised
world.
</p>

<p>
In nothing is the sham super-man more easily
detected than in the confidence and self-complacency
with which he pounces upon the immediate small
advantage, regardless of the penalty he will have to
pay in the future.  By spreading death and devastation
broadcast in Belgium the Germans hoped to attain
three things, and it is not impossible that they have
succeeded in attaining them all.  They sought to
secure their communications by putting the fear of
death, and worse than death, into the hearts of the civil
population.  They sought to send the countryside
fleeing terror-stricken before their advance, choking
and cumbering the highways; than which nothing is
ever more hampering to the operations of an army in
retreat, or more depressing to its spirits.  But chiefly
they desired to set a ruthless object-lesson before the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
eyes of Holland, in order to show her the consequences
of resistance; so that when it came to her turn to
answer a summons to surrender she might have the
good sense not to make a fuss.  They desired in their
dully-calculating, official minds that Holland might
never forget the clouds of smoke, from burning villages
and homesteads, which the August breezes carried far
across her frontiers; the sights of horror, the tales of
suffering and ruin which tens of thousands of starved,
forlorn, and hurrying fugitives brought with them
when they came seeking sanctuary in her territories.
But if the Germans gained all this, and even if
they gained in addition the loving admiration of
the Young Turks, was it worth while to purchase
these advantages at such a price?  It seems a poor
bargain to save your communications, if thereby you
lose the good opinion of the whole world.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
What is of most interest to ourselves, however,
in the long list of miscalculations, is the confidence
of Germany that Britain would remain neutral.  For
a variety of reasons which satisfied the able bureaucrats
at Berlin, it was apparently taken for granted by
them that we were determined to stand out; and
indeed that we were in no position to come in even if
we would.  We conjecture that the reports of German
ambassadors, councillors, consuls, and secret service
agents must have been very certain and unanimous
in this prediction.
</p>

<p>
According to the German theory, the British race,
at home and abroad, was wholly immersed in gain,
and in a kind of pseudo-philanthropy&mdash;in making
money, and in paying blackmail to the working-classes
in order to be allowed to go on making money.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
Our social legislation and our 'People's Budgets' were
regarded in Germany with contempt, as sops and
shams, wanting in thoroughness and tainted with
hypocrisy.
</p>

<p>
English politicians, acting upon the advice of
obliging financiers, had been engaged during recent
years (so grossly was the situation misjudged by our
neighbours) in imposing taxation which hit the
trader, manufacturer, and country-gentleman as hard
as possible; which also hit the working-class hard,
though indirectly; but which left holes through which
the financiers themselves&mdash;by virtue of their
international connections and affiliations&mdash;could glide
easily into comparative immunity.
</p>

<p>
From these faulty premisses, Germans concluded
that Britain was held in leading-strings by certain
sentimentalists who wanted vaguely to do good; and
that these sentimentalists, again, were helped and
guided by certain money-lenders and exploiters, who
were all very much in favour of paying ransom out
of other people's pockets.  A nation which had come
to this pass would be ready enough to sacrifice future
interests&mdash;being blind to them&mdash;for the comforts of
a present peace.
</p>

<p>
The Governments of the United Kingdom and the
Dominions were largely influenced&mdash;so it was believed
at Berlin&mdash;by crooks and cranks of various sorts, by
speculators and 'speculatists,'[<a id="chap0106fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0106fn2">2</a>] many of them of foreign
origin or descent&mdash;who preached day in and day out
the doctrine that war was an anachronism, <i>vieux jeu</i>,
even an impossibility in the present situation of the
world.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a id="chap0106fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0106fn2text">2</a>] 'Speculatists' was a term used
by contemporary American writers
to describe the eloquent theorists
who played so large a part in the French
Revolution.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
</p>

<p>
The British Government appeared to treat these
materially-minded visionaries with the highest favour.
Their advice was constantly sought; they were
recipients of the confidences of Ministers; they
played the part of Lords Bountiful to the party
organisations; they were loaded with titles, if not
with honour.  Their abhorrence of militarism knew
no bounds, and to a large extent it seemed to German,
and even to English eyes, as if they carried the
Cabinet, the party-machine, and the press along
with them.
</p>

<p>
'Militarism,' as used by these enthusiasts, was a
comprehensive term.  It covered with ridicule and
disrepute even such things as preparation for the
defence of the national existence.  International
law was solemnly recommended as a safer defence
than battleships.
</p>

<p>
Better certainly, they allowed, if militarism could
be rooted out in all countries; but at any rate England,
the land of their birth or adoption, must be saved
from the contamination of this brutalising idea.  In
their anxiety to discredit Continental exemplars
they even went so far as to evolve an ingenious
theory, that foreign nations which followed in the
paths of militarism, did so at serious loss to
themselves, but with wholly innocent intentions.  More
especially, they insisted, was this true in the case of
Germany.
</p>

<p>
The Liberal party appeared to listen to these
opinions with respect; Radicals hailed them with
enthusiasm; while the Labour party was at one time
so much impressed, as to propose through some of its
more progressive spirits that, in the exceedingly
unlikely event of a German landing, working-men
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
should continue steadily at their usual labours and
pay no heed to the military operations of the
invaders.
</p>

<p>
In Berlin, apparently, all this respect and
enthusiasm for pacifism, together with the concrete
proposals for putting its principles into practice,
were taken at their face value.  There at any rate
it was confidently believed that the speculators and
the 'speculatists' had succeeded in changing or erasing
the spots of the English leopard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ERRORS OF INFERENCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
But in order to arrive at such a conclusion as this
the able German bureaucrats must have understood
very little, one would think, of human nature in
general, and of British human nature in particular.
Clearly they built more hopes on our supposed
conversion to pacifism than the foundations would stand.
They were right, of course, in counting it a benefit
to themselves that we were unprepared and
unsuspicious of attack; that we had pared down our
exiguous army and stinted our navy somewhat beyond
the limits of prudence.  They were foolish, however,
not to perceive that if the British people found
themselves confronted with the choice, between a war
which they believed to be righteous, and a peace
which they saw clearly would not only be wounding
to their own honour but ruinous to their security, all
their fine abstract convictions would go by the board;
that party distinctions would then for the time being
disappear, and the speculators and the 'speculatists'
would be interned in the nethermost pit of national
distrust....  In so far, therefore, as the Germans
reckoned on our unpreparedness they were wise;
but in counting upon British neutrality they were
singularly wide of the mark.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
</p>

<p>
One imagines that among the idealists of Berlin
there must surely have been a few sceptics who did
not altogether credit this wholesale conversion and
quakerisation of the British race.  But for these
doubters, if indeed they existed, there were other
considerations of a more practical kind which seemed
to indicate that Britain must certainly stand aside.
</p>

<p>
The first and most important of these was the
imminence of civil war in Ireland.  If Prince
Lichnowsky and Baron von Kuhlmann reported that this
had become inevitable, small blame to their
perspicacity!  For in this their judgment only tallied
with that of most people in the United Kingdom who
had any knowledge of the true facts.
</p>

<p>
In March an incident occurred among the troops
stationed in Ireland which must have given comfort
at Berlin, even in greater measure than it caused
disquiet at home.  For it showed in a vivid flash
the intrinsic dangers of the Irish situation, and the
tension, almost to breaking-point, which existed
between the civil authorities and the fighting services.
</p>

<p>
It also showed, what in the circumstances must
have been peculiarly reassuring to the German
Government, that our Navy and Army were under
the charge of Ministers whose judgments were apt
to be led captive by their tempers.  Although the
Secretary of State for War did not remain in office
for many days to encourage the hearts of the general
staff at Berlin, his important post was never filled.
It was only occupied and kept warm by the Prime
Minister, whose labours and responsibilities&mdash;according
to the notions of the Germans, who are a painstaking
and thorough people&mdash;were already enough
for one man to undertake.  Moreover, the First
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
Lord of the Admiralty had not resigned; and it
was perhaps natural, looking at what had just
happened, to conclude that he would be wholly
incapable of the sound and swift decision by which
a few months later he was destined to atone for his
recent blunder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE DUBLIN RIOT
</span>
</p>

<p>
Moreover, although the Curragh incident, as it
was called, had been patched over in a sort of way,
the danger of civil war in Ireland had not diminished
in the least by Midsummer.  Indeed it had sensibly
increased.  During the interval large quantities of
arms and ammunition had been imported by Ulstermen
in defiance of the Government, and Nationalists
were eagerly engaged in emulating their example.
The emergency conference of the leaders of parties
which the King, acting upon the desperate advice
of his Ministers, had called together at Buckingham
Palace ended in complete failure.
</p>

<p>
On Monday the 27th of July readers of the morning
newspapers, looking anxiously for news of the Servian
reply to the Austrian ultimatum, found their eyes
distracted by even blacker headlines, which announced
that a Scots regiment had fired on a Dublin mob.
</p>

<p>
How the bureaucrats of Berlin must have rubbed
their hands and admired their own prescience!  Civil
war in Ireland had actually begun, and in the very
nick of time!  And this occurrence, no less dramatic
than opportune, was a triumph not merely for German
foresight but for German contrivance&mdash;like a good
many other things, indeed, which have taken place
of late.  When the voyage of the good ship <i>Fanny</i>,
which in April carried arms to the coast of Antrim,
comes to be written, and that of the anonymous yacht
which sailed from German waters, transhipped its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
cargo in the channel, whence it was safely conveyed
by another craft to Dublin Bay to kindle this blaze
in July&mdash;when these narratives are set out by some
future historian, as they deserve to be, but not until
then, it will be known how zealously, benevolently,
and impartially our loyal and kindly Teuton cousins
forwarded and fomented the quarrel between
Covenanter and Nationalist.  What the German bureaucrats,
however, with all their foresight, apparently
did not in the least foresee, was that the wound which
they had intentionally done so much to keep open,
they would speedily be helping unintentionally to
heal.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With regard to South Africa, German miscalculation
and intrigue pursued a somewhat similar course,
though with little better results.  It was assumed
that South Africa, having been fully incorporated
in the Empire as a self-governing unit only twelve
years earlier, and as the result of a prolonged and
sanguinary war, must necessarily be bent on severing
the British connection at the earliest opportunity.
The Dutch, like the frogs in the fable, were imagined
to be only awaiting a favourable moment to exchange
the tyranny of King Log for the benevolent rule of
King Stork.
</p>

<p>
In these forecasts, however, various considerations
were overlooked.  In the first place, the
methods of incorporation pursued by the British in
South Africa were as nearly as possible the opposite
of those adopted by Prussia in Poland, in
Schleswig-Holstein, and in Alsace-Lorraine.  In many quarters
there were doubtless bitter memories among the Dutch,
and in some others disappointed ambition still ached;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
but these forces were not enough to plunge into serious
civil war two races which, after nearly a century
of strife and division, had but a few years before
entered into a solemn and voluntary covenant to make
a firm union, and dwell henceforth in peace one with
another.  What object could there be for Dutchmen
to rise in rebellion against a government, which
consisted almost exclusively of Dutch statesmen,
and which had been put in office and was kept there
by the popular vote?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MISTAKES AS TO DUTCH
</span>
</p>

<p>
What German intrigue and bribery could do it
did.  But Dutchmen whose recollections went back
so far as twenty years were little likely to place
excessive confidence in the incitements and
professions of Berlin.  They remembered with what busy
intrigues Germany had in former times encouraged
their ambitions, with what a rich bribery of promises
she had urged them on to war, with what cold indifference,
when war arose, she had left them to their fate.
They also remembered how, when their aged President,
an exiled and broken-hearted man, sought an interview
with the great sovereign whose consideration
for him in his more prosperous days had never lacked
for warmth, he received for an answer, that Berlin
was no place for people who had been beaten to come
whining, and was turned from the door.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In India, as in South Africa, Germany entertained
confident hopes of a successful rising.  Had not the
Crown Prince, a shrewd judge, visited there a few
years earlier and formed his own estimate of the
situation?  Was there not a widely spread network
of sedition covering the whole of our Eastern Empire,
an incendiary press, and orators who openly counselled
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
violence and preached rebellion?  Had not riots
been increasing rapidly in gravity and number?
Had not assassins been actively pursuing their trade?
Had not a ship-load of Indians just been refused
admission to Canada, thereby causing a not unnatural
outburst of indignation?
</p>

<p>
How far German statesmen had merely foreseen
these things, how far they had actually contrived
them, we are as yet in ignorance; but judging by
what has happened in other places&mdash;in Ireland,
South Africa, Belgium, and France&mdash;it would
surprise no one to learn that the bombs which
were thrown at the Viceroy and his wife with tragic
consequences owed something to German teaching.
It is unlikely that German emissaries had been less
active in fomenting unrest in India than elsewhere
among the subjects of nations with which they were
ostensibly at peace; while the fact that the Crown
Prince had but recently enjoyed the hospitality of
the Viceregal Court was only a sentimental consideration
unworthy of the attention of super-men.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, it had for long been abundantly clear,
on <i>a priori</i> grounds, to thinkers like Treitschke and
Bernhardi that India was already ripe for rebellion
on a grand scale.  There are but two things which
affect the Indian mind with awe and submission&mdash;a
sublime philosophy and a genius for war.  The
English had never been philosophers, and they had
ceased to be warriors.  How, then, could a race which
worshipped only soldiers and sages be expected to
reverence and obey a garrison of clerks and
shopkeepers?  A war between England and Germany
would provide an opportunity for making an end for
ever of the British Raj.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MISTAKES AS TO DOMINIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The self-governing Dominions were believed to
be affected with the same decadent spirit and fantastic
illusions as their Mother Country; only with them
these cankers had spread more widely, were more
logically followed out in practice, and less tempered
and restrained by aristocratic tradition.  Their
eloquent outpourings of devotion and cohesion were
in reality quite valueless; merely what in their own
slang is known as 'hot air.'  They hated militarism
in theory and practice, and they loved making money
with at least an equal fervour.  Consequently, it was
absurd to suppose that their professions of loyalty
would stand the strain of a war, by which not only
their national exchequers, but the whole mass of the
people must inevitably be impoverished, in which
the manhood of the Dominions would be called on
for military service, and their defenceless territories
placed in danger of invasion.
</p>

<p>
It was incredible to the wise men at Berlin that
the timid but clear minds of English Statesmen had
not appreciated these obvious facts.  War, therefore,
would be avoided as long as possible.  And when
at a later date, war was forced by Germany upon the
pusillanimous islanders, the Dominions would
immediately discern various highly moral pleas for
standing aloof.  Germany, honouring these pleas
for the time being with a mock respect, would defer
devouring the Dominions until she had digested the
more serious meal.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It will be seen from all this how good the grounds
were on which the best-informed and most efficient
bureaucracy in the world decided that the British
Empire would remain neutral in the present war.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
Looked at from the strictly intellectual standpoint,
the reasons which satisfied German Statesmen with
regard to Britain's neutrality were overwhelming, and
might well have convinced others, of a similar outlook
and training, who had no personal interest whatsoever
in coming to one conclusion rather than another.
</p>

<p>
None the less the judgment of the Kaiser and his
Ministers was not only bad, but inexcusably bad.
We expect more from statesmen than that they
should arrive at logical conclusions.  Logic in such
cases is nothing; all that matters is to be right;
but unless instinct rules and reason serves, right
judgment will rarely be arrived at in such matters as
these.  If a man cannot feel as well as reason, if he
cannot gauge the forces which are at work among the
nations by some kind of second-sight, he has no title
to set up his bills as a statesman.  It is incredible
that Lincoln, Cavour, or Bismarck would ever have
blundered into such a war as this, under the delusion
that Britain could remain neutral even if she would.
Nor would any of these three have been so far out in
his reckoning as to believe, that the immediate effect
of such a war, if Britain joined in it, would be the
disruption of her empire.  They might have calculated
that in the event of the war being prolonged and
disastrous to England, disintegration would in the
end come about; but without stopping to reason
the matter out, they would have known by instinct,
that the first effect produced by such a war would
be a consolidation and knitting together of the loose
Imperial fabric, and a suspension, or at least a
diminution, of internal differences.

CHAPTER VII
<br />
INTERNATIONAL ILL-WILL
</h3>

<p>
In the foregoing pages an attempt has been made
to consider the series of events which immediately
preceded the recent outbreak of war.  But the most
complete account of moves and counter-moves, and
of all the pretexts, arguments, demands, and appeals
which were put forward by the various governments
concerned, with the object of forcing on, justifying,
circumscribing, or preventing the present struggle,
can never give us the true explanation of why it
occurred.  For this we must look much further back
than Midsummer last, and at other things besides
the correspondence between Foreign Ministers and
Ambassadors.
</p>

<p>
Nobody in his senses believes that Europe is at
present in a convulsion because the heir-presumptive to
the throne of Austria was murdered at Serajevo on the
28th of June.  This event was tragic and deplorable,
but it was merely a spark&mdash;one of that cloud of sparks
which is always issuing from the chimney-stack of
the European furnace.  This one by ill-luck happened
to fall upon a heap of combustibles, and set it in a
blaze.
</p>

<p>
Great events, as the Greeks discovered several
thousand years ago, do not spring from small causes,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
though more often than not they have some trivial
beginning.  How came it that so much inflammable
material was lying ready to catch fire?
</p>

<p>
To answer this question truthfully we need more
knowledge of men and things than is given in those
books, of varying hue, which the Chancelleries of Europe
have published to explain their causes of action.  The
official sources provide much valuable information;
but they will never explain to us why public opinion
in Germany, ever since the beginning of the present
century, has been inflamed with hatred against this
country.  Nor will they ever give us any clear idea as
to what extent, and where, the practical aims and
policies of that nation and our own were in conflict.
</p>

<p>
According to the state papers, it would appear
that Russia was drawn into this war because of Servia,
and France because of Russia, and Belgium because of
France, and we ourselves because of Belgium; but
it may well be doubted if even the first of this row
of ninepins would have been allowed to fall, had it
not been for the feelings which the German people
and their rulers entertained towards Britain.
</p>

<p>
It is always hard for a man to believe in the
sincerity, friendliness, and peaceful intentions of one
against whom he is himself engaged in plotting an
injury.  German distrust of England was based upon
the surest of all foundations&mdash;upon her own fixed
and envious determination to overthrow our empire
and rob us of our property.  Her own mind being
filled with this ambition, how could she be otherwise
than incredulous of our expressions of goodwill?
How could she conceive that we were so blind as not
to have penetrated her thoughts, so deaf as not to
have heard the threats which her public characters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
were proclaiming so openly?  Consequently when
British Statesmen uttered amiable assurances they
were judged guilty of a treacherous dissimulation....
One can only shrug one's shoulders, marvelling at
the nightmares and suspicions which a bad conscience
is capable of producing even among intelligent people.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE DANGER POINT
</span>
</p>

<p>
It has been the fashion for half a century or more
to talk of the Balkans as the danger-point of European
peace.  In a sense this is true.  The crust is very
thin in that region, and violent eruptions are of
common occurrence.  But the real danger of upheaval
comes, not so much from the thinness of the crust,
as from the violence of the subterranean forces.
Of these, by far the most formidable in recent times
have been the attitude of public opinion in Germany
towards England&mdash;the hatred of England which has
been sedulously and systematically inculcated among
the people of all ranks&mdash;the suspicions of our policy
which have been sown broadcast&mdash;the envy of our
position in the world which has been instilled, without
remission, by all and sundry the agencies and
individuals subject to the orders and inspiration of
government.  An obsession has been created, by
these means, which has distorted the whole field of
German vision.  National ill-will accordingly has
refused to yield to any persuasion.  Like its contrary,
the passion of love, it has burned all the more
fiercely, being unrequited.
</p>

<p>
The fact which it is necessary to face, fairly and
squarely, is that we are fighting the whole German
people.  We may blame, and blame justly, the
Prussian junkers, the German bureaucracy, the
Kaiser himself, for having desired this war, schemed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
for it, set the match to it by intention or through
a blunder; but to regard it as a Kaiser's war, or a
junkers' war, or a bureaucrats' war is merely to
deceive ourselves.  It is a people's war if ever there
was one.  It could not have been more a people's
war than it is, even if Germany had been a democracy
like France or England.
</p>

<p>
The Kaiser, as regards this matter, is the mirror
of his people.  The Army and the Navy are his
trusted servants against whom not a word will be
believed.  The wisdom of the bureaucracy is
unquestioned.  In matters of faith the zealous eloquence
of the learned men is wholly approved.  All classes
are as one in devotion, and are moved by the
same spirit of self-sacrifice.  Hardly a murmur of
criticism has been heard, even from the multitudes
who at other times march under the red flag of
Socialism.
</p>

<p>
Although a German panic with regard to Russia
may have been the proximate occasion of this war,
the force which most sustains it in its course is
German hatred of England.  We must recognise this
fact with candour, however painful it may be.  And
we must also note that, during the past nine months,
the feelings against England have undergone a change
by no means for the better.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning the German people, if we may
judge from published utterances, were convinced
that the war had been engineered by Russia, and
that England had meanly joined in it, because she
saw her chance of crushing a dangerous and envied
rival.
</p>

<p>
Two months later, however, it was equally clear
that the German people were persuaded&mdash;Heaven
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
knows how or why!&mdash;that the war had been engineered
by England, who was using France and Russia as
her tools.  Behind Russia, France, Belgium, Servia,
and Japan&mdash;according to this view&mdash;stood
Britain&mdash;perfidious throughout the ages&mdash;guiding her
puppets with indefatigable skill to the destruction
of German trade, colonies, navy, and world-power.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
FANTASTIC ERRORS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Confiding Germany, in spite of all her unremitting
abuse of Britain, had apparently, for some reason,
really believed her to be a friend and a fellow Teuton!
Could any treachery have been blacker than our
own in outraging these family affections?  And for
Britain to support the Slav and the Celt against the
Teuton, was judged to be the worst treachery of
all&mdash;race treachery&mdash;especially by the Prussians, who,
having forgotten that they themselves are half Slavs,
seemed also to have forgotten that the British are
largely Celts.
</p>

<p>
Every Englishman, whether he be an admirer
of Sir Edward Grey's administration of Foreign
Affairs or not, knows these dark suspicions to be
merely nonsense.  He knows this as one of the
common certainties of existence&mdash;just as he knows
that ginger is hot i' the mouth.  Every Englishman
knows that Sir Edward Grey, his colleagues, his
advisers, his supporters in Parliament and out of
it, and the whole British race throughout the world,
hated the idea of war, and would have done&mdash;and
in fact did, so far as in them lay&mdash;everything they
could think of to avert it.  Yet the German people
do not at present believe a single word of this; and
there must be some reason for their disbelief as for
other things.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the nations of the world never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
see one another face to face.  They carry on their
intercourse, friendly and otherwise, by high-angle
fire, from hidden batteries of journalistic howitzers.
Sometimes the projectiles which they exchange are
charged with ideal hate which explodes and kills;
at others with ideal love and admiration which
dissolve in golden showers, delightful and amazing to
behold.  But always the gunners are invisible to
each other, and the ideal love and admiration are
often as far removed from the real merits of their
objective as the ideal hate.
</p>

<p>
That there was no excuse, beyond mere fancy
on Germany's part, for her distrust of British policy,
no one, unless he were wholly ignorant of the facts,
would dream of maintaining.  During the years
which have passed since 1870, our intentions have
very rarely been unfriendly.  Still more rarely,
however, have we ever shown any real comprehension of
the German point of view.  Never have we made
our policy clear.  The last is hardly to be wondered
at, seeing that we had not ourselves taken the pains
to understand it.
</p>

<p>
On occasions, it is true, we have been effusive,
and have somewhat overstepped the limits of dignity,
plunging into a gushing sentimentality, or else
wheedling and coaxing, with some material object&mdash;the
abatement of naval expenditure, for example&mdash;showing
very plainly through our blandishments.
And as our methods at these times have been lacking
in self-respect, it is not wonderful if they have
earned little or no respect from others.  Our
protestations that we were friends, our babble about
blood-relationship, were suspected to have their origin in
timidity; our appeals for restriction of armaments,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
to our aversion from personal sacrifice and our senile
penuriousness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
FAULTS OF ENGLISH METHODS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Until lately these lapses into excessive amiability,
it must be allowed, were not very frequent.  The
main excuse for German suspicion is to be found
elsewhere&mdash;in the dilatoriness of our foreign policy&mdash;in
its inability to make up its mind&mdash;in its changeability
after its mind might have been supposed
made up&mdash;in its vagueness with regard to the nature
of our obligations towards other powers&mdash;whom we
would support, and to what extent, and upon what
pleas.
</p>

<p>
Irritation on the part of Germany would have
been natural in these circumstances, even if she had
not been in the mood to suspect dark motives in the
background.  From the days of Lord Granville to
those of Sir Edward Grey, we had been dealing with
a neighbour who, whatever her failings might be,
was essentially businesslike in her methods.  We,
on the other hand, continued to exhibit many of
those faults which are most ill-regarded by business
men.  We would not say clearly what regions came
within our sphere of influence.  We would not say
clearly where Germany might go and where we
should object to her going; but wherever she went,
we were apt after the event to grumble and make
trouble.
</p>

<p>
The delay and indecision which marked Lord
Granville's dealings with Bismarck over the partition
of Africa were both bad manners in the international
sense, and bad policy.  The neglect of Sir Edward
Grey, after Agadir, to make clear to his fellow-countrymen,
and to the world at large, the nature and extent
of our obligations to France, was bad business.  Next
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
to the British people and our present allies, Germany
had the best reason to complain of this procedure,
or rather of this failure to proceed.
</p>

<p>
The blame for this unfortunate record rests mainly
upon our political system, rather than on individuals.
We cannot enjoy the benefits of the most highly
developed party system in the world, without losing
by it in various directions.  A change of Government,
actual or impending, has more often been the
cause of procrastination and uncertainty than change
in the mind of the Foreign Minister.  There are people
who assure us that this must always be so, that it
is one of the inherent weaknesses of party government,
and even of democracy itself.  This is not
altogether true.  It is true, however, that whereas
statesmen may be reticent and keep their own counsel
under an autocracy, they are bound to be frank, and
simple, and outspoken as to their aims, where their
power is drawn directly from popular support.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
BAD DIPLOMACY
</span>
</p>

<p>
The criticism against British foreign policy for
upwards of a century, is that it has aimed at managing
our international relations on a system of hoodwinking
the people, which is altogether incompatible with
the nature of our institutions.  The evils which
have resulted from this mistake are not confined to
ourselves, but have reacted abroad.  "With whom,"
we can imagine some perplexed foreign Chancellor
asking himself&mdash;"with whom does power really
rest in England?  With the Government or with
the people?  With which of these am I to deal?
To which must I address myself?  As regards
France there is little difficulty, for her policy is
national, and agreed on all hands.  But in England,
so far as we can judge, the people have no idea of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
being dragged under any circumstances into a
European war; while on the other hand, the
Government is obviously drifting, consciously or
unconsciously, into continental relations which, in certain
events, can lead to no other result...."  Nor is
it surprising that under these conditions German
diplomacy should have directed itself of late, with
much industry, to the cultivation of public opinion
in this country, and should at times have treated our
Government with scant respect.
</p>

<p>
The fact is that the two nations, which had most
to gain by clear-sighted and tactful foreign policy,
were perhaps of all nations in the world the least
well served in that particular.  English relations
with Germany have for many years past been more
mismanaged than anything except German relations
with England.  In their mutual diplomacy the fingers
of both nations have been all thumbs.
</p>

<p>
It is not to be wondered at that two characters
so antagonistic in their natures and methods as
English and German foreign policy should have come
to regard one another as impossible.  The aggressive
personage who does know his own mind, and the
vague, supercilious personage who does not, have
only one point in common&mdash;that they understand
and care very little about the feelings of other people.
But although this is a point in common, it is anything
but a point of agreement.[<a id="chap0107fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0107fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
The causes of what has happened will never be
clear to us unless we can arrive at some understanding
of the ideas, aspirations, and dreams which have filled
the minds of the German people and our own during
recent years.  On logical grounds we must consider
the case of Germany first, for the reason that all
the warmth of enmity has proceeded from her side,
and, until recent events suddenly aroused the Old
Adam in us, the uncharitable sentiments of our
neighbours were not at all cordially reciprocated
over here.
</p>

<p>
As in romantic drama, according to the cynics,
there is usually one who loves and another who
allows itself to be loved, so in this case there was
one who hated and another who allowed itself to be
hated.  The British nation could not understand
why the Germans were so angry and suspicious.
Nor would it trouble to understand.  It was bored
with the whole subject; and even the irritation
which it felt at having to find huge sums annually
for the Navy did not succeed in shaking it out of its
boredom.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
INTERNATIONAL MISCONCEPTIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The most careful analysis of our thoughts about
Germany would do little to explain matters, because,
as it happened, by far the greater part of our
thoughts was occupied with other things.  Indeed we
thought about Germany as little as we could help
thinking; and although we regretted her annoyance,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
our consciences absolved us from any responsibility
for it.
</p>

<p>
It was entirely different with Germany.  For
many years past she had been more occupied with
her grievances against Britain, and with the
complications and dangers which would beset any attempt
at redress, than with any other single subject; or
indeed, so it would appear, with all other subjects
put together.
</p>

<p>
It is important to understand the German point
of view, but it is difficult.  For at once we are faced
with the eternal obstacle of the foreigner, who sets out
in search of a simple explanation.  The mind of the
ordinary man, like that of the philosopher, is
hypnotised by a basic assumption of the One-ness of Things.
He wants to trace all trouble to a single root, as if
it were a corn and could be extracted.  But in an
enquiry like the present we are confronted at every
turn with the Two-ness of Things, or indeed with the
Multiplicity of Things.
</p>

<p>
We have only to read a few pages of any German
book on England to see that the other party to the
dispute is confronted with exactly the same difficulty.
We are amazed, and perhaps not altogether chagrined,
to discover that, to German eyes, British policy
appears to be a thing of the most rigorous consistency.
It is deliberate, far-sighted, and ruthless.  It
is pursued with constancy from decade to decade&mdash;nay
from century to century&mdash;never faltering, never
retreating, but always going forward under Whig and
Tory, Liberal and Conservative alike, to the same
goal.  And we of course know, if we know anything,
that this picture, though very flattering to our
political instinct, is untrue.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
</p>

<p>
If Englishmen know anything at all, they know
that the foreign policy of this country during the
last fifty years&mdash;under Lord Beaconsfield, and
Mr. Gladstone, Lord Salisbury, and Mr. Asquith&mdash;has
been at times a series of the most eccentric wobbles
and plunges, like a kite which is drawn at the wrong
angle to the wind.  Nay, even as regards our
participation in this very War&mdash;which in the German
White Book is asserted to have been preconceived
and undertaken by us with a craft and coolness
worthy of Machiavelli himself&mdash;we can see from
our own White Paper that the final decision wavered
this way and the other, from day to day during the
critical week, neither the Cabinet nor public opinion
being clear and unanimous as to the course which
ought to be pursued.
</p>

<p>
Vacillation in national policy usually appears to
hostile observers in the light of perfidy.  And it
must be admitted that there is good excuse for the
mistake, seeing that weakness in such high matters
is quite as likely to injure everybody concerned as
wickedness itself.
</p>

<p>
Assuredly no sensible person who was required
to make a defence of British foreign policy, either
during the century which has passed since the battle
of Waterloo, or in the much shorter period since the
death of Queen Victoria, would ever dream of doing
so on the ground that its guiding principles have
been consistency and singleness of purpose.  These,
indeed, are almost the last virtues he would think
of claiming for it.  And yet these are the very
qualities which foreign nations are inclined to attribute
to British statesmen, by way of praise or blame.
Our failures are apt to be overlooked by outside
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
observers; our successes on the other hand are plain
and memorable.  Other nations assume that because
we have happened to achieve some particular result,
we must therefore have deliberately and patiently
set out to achieve it.  Much more often this result
has been due either to pure good luck or else to some
happy inspiration of the moment.
</p>

<p>
A wise apologist for our foreign policy would at
once concede that it has frequently been characterised
by feebleness and indecision, and almost
always by a want of clear perception of the end in
view; but he could contend with justice that upon
the whole, for upwards of a century, it has meant
well by other nations, and that accusations of
far-sighted duplicity are purely ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
Our own temptation on the other hand is to
visualise a single, gross, overbearing, and opinionated
type of the Teuton species.  We tend to ignore
important differences; and because German public
opinion appears to be unanimous in regard to the
present War, we are apt to overlook the fact that
the love and admiration of the Bavarian and the
Saxon for the Prussian are probably some degrees
less cordial than those which the men of Kerry
and Connemara entertain for the Belfast Covenanters.
And we incline also to forget, that though opinion in
Germany in favour of war became solid so soon as
war was apprehended, and certainly before it was
declared, it is exceedingly unlikely, that even in
governing circles, there was an equal unanimity as
to the procedure which led up to the climax.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE TRIANGLE OF FORCES
</span>
</p>

<p>
If it were really so, the case is unique in history,
which shows us at every other crisis of this sort always
the same triangle of forces&mdash;a War party, a Peace
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
party, and a Wait-and-See party; each of them
pulling vigorously in its own direction; each intriguing
against, and caballing with, the other two by turns;
until at last the group, still struggling, falls back on
the side of safety or, as in the recent instance, pitches
over the edge of the precipice.
</p>

<p>
It would be very hard to persuade any student
of history that something of this sort was not
occurring both in Vienna and Berlin during the months of
June and July 1914.  While he would admit to more
than a suspicion that intelligences had been passing
for a considerably longer period&mdash;for a year at
least[<a id="chap0107fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0107fn2">2</a>]&mdash;between the War parties in these two capitals, he
would be inclined to take the view, that in the last
stage of all, the Berlin group went staggering to
perdition, dragging after it the Vienna group, which
by that time was struggling feebly in the opposite
direction.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LIMITS OF ENQUIRY
</span>
</p>

<p>
When we come to consider the German case it
is wise to bear in mind the erroneous judgments
which foreigners have passed upon ourselves.  It
is probable that the One-ness of things which we
discover in their actions is to some extent an illusion,
like that which they have discovered in our own.
Indeed it is a fruitless task to hunt for logic and
consistency in things which, in their nature, are neither
logical nor consistent.  For most of us, who have
but a limited range of German books, state papers,
journalism, and acquaintances to judge from, it would
be vain and foolish to pretend that in a chapter, or
a volume, we can lay bare the German attitude of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
mind.  The most we can hope to do is to illuminate
this complex subject at certain points; and these
for the most part are where the edges rub, and where
German policy and temperament have happened to
come into conflict with our own.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0107fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0107fn1text">1</a>] If we may offer a very homely simile&mdash;German
policy may be compared
to a rude heavy fellow, who comes shoving
his way into a crowded bus,
snorting aggressively, treading
on everybody's corns, poking his umbrella
into people's eyes, and finally plumping
himself down without a word of
regret or apology, between the two meekest
and most helpless-looking of
the passengers.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
British diplomacy, on the other hand,
bears a close resemblance to a
nuisance, equally well known to the bus public,
and no less dreaded.  It
reminds us constantly of that dawdling,
disobliging female who never can
make up her mind, till the bus has actually
started, whether she wants to
go to Shepherd's Bush or the Mansion House.
If she has taken a seat
she insists on stopping the conveyance
in order to get out.  If she has
remained gaping on the pavement she hails
it in order to get in.  She cares
nothing about the inconvenience caused
thereby to other passengers, who
do know whither they want to be conveyed,
and desire to arrive at their
destination as quickly as possible.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
THE BISMARCKIAN EPOCH
</h3>

<p>
All nations dream&mdash;some more than others; while
some are more ready than others to follow their
dreams into action.  Nor does the prevalence, or
even the intensity, of these national dreams seem to
bear any fixed relation to the strength of will which
seeks to turn them into achievement.
</p>

<p>
After 1789 there was a great deal of dreaming
among the nations of Europe.  At the beginning of
it all was revolutionary France, who dreamed of
offering freedom to all mankind.  A few years later, an
altogether different France was dreaming furiously
of glory for her own arms.  In the end it was still
France who dreamed; and this time she sought to
impose the blessings of peace, order, and uniformity
upon the whole world.  Her first dream was realised
in part, the second wholly; but the third ended in
ruin.
</p>

<p>
Following upon this momentous failure came a
short period when the exhausted nations slept much
too soundly to dream dreams.  During this epoch
Europe was parcelled out artificially, like a patch-work
quilt, by practical and unimaginative diplomatists,
anxious certainly to take securities for a lasting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
peace, but still more anxious to bolster up the ancient
dynasties.
</p>

<p>
Against their arbitrary expedients there was
soon a strong reaction, and dreaming began once
more among the nations, as they turned in their sleep,
and tried to stretch their hampered limbs.  At the
beginning their dreaming was of a mild and somewhat
futile type.  It called itself 'liberalism'&mdash;a name
coined upon the continent of Europe.  It aimed by
methods of peaceful persuasion, at reaching the
double goal of nationality as the ideal unit of the state,
and popular representation as the ideal system of
government.  Then the seams of the patchwork,
which had been put together with so much labour
at Vienna[<a id="chap0201fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn1">1</a>] and Aix-la-Chapelle,[<a id="chap0201fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn2">2</a>] began to gape.
Greece struggled with some success to free herself
from the Turk,[<a id="chap0201fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn3">3</a>] and Belgium broke away from
Holland,[<a id="chap0201fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn4">4</a>] as at a much later date Norway severed
her union with Sweden.[<a id="chap0201fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn5">5</a>]  In 1848 there were
revolutions all over Europe, the objects of which were the
setting up of parliamentary systems.  In all directions
it seemed as if the dynastic stitches were coming
undone.  Italy dreamed of union and finally achieved
it,[<a id="chap0201fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn6">6</a>] expelling the Austrian encroachers&mdash;though not
by peaceful persuasion&mdash;and disordering still further
the neatly sewn handiwork of Talleyrand, Metternich,
and Castlereagh.  Finally, the Balkans began to
dream of Slav destinies, unrealisable either under
the auspices of the Sublime Porte or in tutelage to
the Habsburgs.[<a id="chap0201fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MAKING OF THE GERMAN UNION
</span>
</p>

<p>
But of all the nations which have dreamed since
days long before Napoleon, none has dreamed more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
nobly or more persistently than Germany.  For the
first half of the nineteenth century it seemed as if
the Germans were satisfied to behold a vision without
attempting to turn it into a reality.  Their aspirations
issued in no effective action.  They dreamed
of union between their many kingdoms, principalities,
and duchies, and of building up a firm empire against
which all enemies would beat in vain; but until
1864 they had gone but a few steps towards the
achievement of this end.
</p>

<p>
Then within a period of seven years, Prussia, the
most powerful of the German states, planned,
provoked, and carried to a successful issue three wars
of aggression.  By a series of swift strokes, the
genius of Bismarck snatched Schleswig-Holstein from
the Danes, beat down the pretensions of Austria to
the leadership of the Teutonic races, and wrested the
provinces of Alsace and Lorraine from France.
When Denmark was invaded by Germanic armies
in February 1864, the vision of unity seemed as
remote as ever; by January 1871 it was fully achieved.
When at Versailles, in the Hall of Mirrors, in the
stately palace of the Bourbons, King William
accepted from the hands of his peers&mdash;the sovereign
rulers of Germany&mdash;an imperial crown, the dream
of centuries was fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
Austria, indeed, stood aloof; but both by reason
of her geographical situation and the heterogeneous
ancestry of her people that was a matter only of
small account.  Union was, for all practical purposes
complete.  And what made the achievement all the
more marvellous was the fact, that the vision had
been realised by methods which had no place in the
gentle speculations of those, who had cherished the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
hope of unity with the most fervent loyalty.  It
had been accomplished by the Prussians, who of all
races between the Alps and the Baltic, between the
mountain barriers of Burgundy and the Polish
Marshes, are the least German in blood,[<a id="chap0201fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn8">8</a>] and who of
all Germans dream the least.  It had been carried
through, not by peaceful persuasion, nor on any
principles of Liberalism, nor in any of the ways
foreseen by the philosophers and poets who had
beheld visions of the millennium.  Union was the
triumph of craft and calculation, courage and resolve,
'blood and iron.'
</p>

<p>
The world in general, whose thoughts at this time
were much more congenially occupied with International
Exhibitions, and Peace Societies, and the
ideals of Manchester statesmanship, was inclined to
regard the whole of this series of events as an
anachronism&mdash;as the belated offspring of 'militarism'
and 'feudalism.'  These were well known to be both
in their dotage; they could not possibly survive for
many years.  What had happened, therefore, did not
startle mankind simply because the nature of it was
not understood.  The spirit of the age, wholly
possessed, as it was, by an opposite set of ideas,
was unable to comprehend, to believe in, or even
to consider with patience, phenomena which, according
to prevailing theories, had no reasonable basis
of existence.
</p>

<p>
In some quarters, indeed, efforts were made to
gloss over the proceedings of Prince Bismarck, and
to fit them into the fashionable theory of a universe,
flowing with the milk of human kindness and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
honey of material prosperity.  It was urged that
the Germans were a people, pure in their morals,
industrious in their habits, the pioneers of higher
education and domestic economy.  For the most
part, British and American public opinion was
inclined to regard these various occurrences and
conquests as a mediaeval masquerade, in rather doubtful
taste, but of no particular significance and involving
no serious consequences.  Even in that enlightened
age, however, there were still a few superstitious
persons who saw ghosts.  To their eyes the shade of
Richard Cobden seemed in some danger of being
eclipsed in the near future by that of Niccolo
Machiavelli; though the former had died in great honour
and prestige only a few years earlier, while the latter
had been dead, discredited, and disavowed for almost
as many centuries.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN PROSPERITY AFTER UNION
</span>
</p>

<p>
After 1870 Germany entered upon a period of
peaceful prosperity.  Forges clanged, workshops
throbbed, looms hummed, and within twenty years,
the ebb of emigration had entirely ceased.  Indeed,
not only was there work in the Fatherland for all its
sons, but for others besides; so that long before
another twenty years had passed away, the tide
had turned and immigrants were pouring in.
</p>

<p>
At first the larger part of German exports was
cheap and nasty, with a piratical habit of sailing
under false colours, and simulating well-known British
and other national trade-marks.  But this was a
brief interlude.  The sagacity, thoroughness, and
enterprise of manufacturers and merchants soon
guided their steps past this dangerous quicksand,
and the label <i>made in Germany</i> ceased to be a reproach.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
</p>

<p>
Students and lovers of truth laboured at discovery;
and hard upon their heels followed a crowd
of practical inventors&mdash;the gleaners, scavengers, and
rag-pickers of science.  Never had the trade of any
country thriven with a more wonderful rapidity.
Though still of necessity a borrower by very reason
of her marvellous expansion, Germany nevertheless
began to make her influence felt in the financial
sphere.  Her own ships carried her products to the
ends of the earth, and fetched home raw materials
in exchange.  And not only this, her merchant
fleets began to enter into successful competition
for the carrying trade of the world, even with the
Mistress of the Seas herself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LIFE'S WORK OF BISMARCK
</span>
</p>

<p>
For a score of years after the fall of Paris, Germany
found but little time for dreaming.  Meanwhile, by
an astute if somewhat tortuous policy, and under
the impenetrable shield of the finest army in Europe,
Bismarck kept safe the empire which he had founded.
He declined to be drawn into adventures either at
home or abroad, either in the new world or the old.
He opposed the colonial aspirations of a few
visionaries, who began to make some noise towards the
end of his long reign, and silenced them with some
spacious but easy acquisitions in Africa and the
East.  He consolidated the Prussian autocracy, and
brought its servant, the bureaucracy, to the highest
pitch of efficiency.  He played with the political
parties in the Reichstag as if they had been a box of
dominoes, combining them into what patterns he
pleased.  At the same time he fostered the national
well-being with ceaseless vigilance, and kept down
popular discontent by the boldness and thoroughness
of his social legislation.  But for Bismarck himself
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
the age of adventure was past.  It was enough
that by the labours of an arduous lifetime, he had
made of Germany a puissant state, in which all her
children, even the most restless, could find full scope
for their soaring ambitions.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
AFTER BISMARCK
</h3>

<p>
With the dismissal of Bismarck in 1890, Germany
entered upon a new phase.  Then once again her
people began to dream, and this time furiously.
They had conquered in war.  They had won great
victories in peace.  According to their own estimate
they were the foremost thinkers of the world.  They
found themselves impelled by a limitless ambition
and a superb self-confidence.  But the vision which
now presented itself to their eyes was disordered and
tumultuous.  Indeed it was less dream than
nightmare; and in some degree, no doubt, it owed its
origin, like other nightmares, to a sudden
surfeit&mdash;to a glut of material prosperity.[<a id="chap0202fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
Why did Germany with her larger population still
lag behind Britain in commerce and shipping?
Surely the reason could only be that Britain, at
every turn, sought to cripple the enterprise of her
young rival.  Why had Britain a great and thriving
colonial empire, while Germany had only a few tracts
of tropical jungle and light soil, not particularly
prosperous or promising?  The reason could only
be that, out of jealousy, Britain had obstructed
Teutonic acquisition.  Why was Germany tending
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
to become more and more isolated and unpopular
in Europe?  The reason could only be that the
crafty and unscrupulous policy of Britain had intrigued,
with some success, for her political ostracism.
</p>

<p>
It is useless to argue with a man in a nightmare.
He brushes reason aside and cares not for facts.
But to seekers after truth it was obvious, that so far
from making any attack upon German commerce,
Britain, by adhering to her system of free trade at
home and in her dependencies, had conferred a boon
immeasurable on this new and eager competitor.
So far from hindering Germany's acquisition of
colonies, Britain had been careless and indifferent
in the matter; perhaps too much so for the security
of some of her own possessions.  It was Bismarck,
much more than Britain, who had put obstacles in the
way of German colonial expansion.  With a sigh of
relief (as we may imagine) this great statesman
saw the partition of the vacant territories of the
world completed, and his fellow-countrymen thereby
estopped from wasting their substance, and
dissipating their energies, in costly and embarrassing
adventures.  So far from holding aloof from
Germany or attempting to isolate her among European
nations, we had persisted in treating her with
friendliness, long after she had ceased to be friendly.  One
of our leading statesmen had even gone the length
of suggesting an alliance, and had been denounced
immediately by the whole German press, although
it was understood at the time that he had spoken
with the august encouragement of the Kaiser and
his Chancellor.[<a id="chap0202fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn2">2</a>]  It was Germany herself, deprived
of the guidance of Bismarck, who by blustering at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
her various neighbours, and threatening them in
turn, had aroused their suspicions and achieved her
own isolation.
</p>

<p>
The grievances against Britain which figured
in the phantasmagoria of the German nightmare
were obviously tinged with envy.  There were other
grievances against France, and these were tinged
with annoyance.  For France, although she had
been beaten on to her knees, had nevertheless had
the impudence to make a successful recovery.  There
were also grievances against Russia, and these were
tinged with fear.  Her vast adjacent territories and
teeming population, her social and industrial progress,
the reformation of her government, and the rapid
recuperation of her military and naval power,
constituted in German eyes the gravest menace of all.
</p>

<p>
Self-confidence and ambition were the original
stuff&mdash;the warp and the weft&mdash;of which the German
dream was made; but these admirable and healthy
qualities rapidly underwent a morbid deterioration.
Ambition degenerated into groundless suspicion, and
self-confidence into arrogance.  It was a considerable
time, however, before Germany was realised
to have become a public danger by reason of her
mental affliction.  Until her prophets and high priests
began preaching from the housetops as a divine
ordinance, that Germany was now so great, prosperous,
and prolific as to need the lands of her neighbours
for her expansion, her symptoms were not generally
recognised.  It was not really pressure of population,
but only the oppression of a nightmare which
had brought her to this restless and excited
condition.  In terms of psychology, the disease from
which Germany has been suffering of late years is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
known as megalomania, in the slang of the
street-corner as madness of the swollen head.
</p>

<p>
The dreams of a nation may be guided well or ill
by statesmen, or they may be left altogether unguided.
The dreams of Italy under Cavour, and those of
Germany under Bismarck, were skilfully fostered
and directed with great shrewdness to certain
practical ends.  But in considering the case of
Germany under William the Second, our feeling is
that although popular imaginings have been
controlled from above with even greater solicitude than
before, the persons who inspired and regulated them
have been lacking in the sense of proportion.  The
governing power would seem to have been the victim
of changing moods, conflicting policies, and
disordered purposes.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
TWO FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
When we piece together the various schemes for
the aggrandisement of the Fatherland, which German
writers have set forth with increasing boldness and
perfect gravity during the past ten years, we are
confronted with an immense mosaic&mdash;a conception
of the most grandiose character.  On examination
each of these projects is found to be based upon two
fundamental assumptions:&mdash;The first, that the present
boundaries of Germany and her possessions overseas
are too narrow to contain the legitimate aspirations
of the German race:&mdash;The second that it is the
immediate interest of Germany, as well as a duty
which she owes to posterity, to remedy this
deficiency, by taking from her neighbours by force
what she requires for her own expansion.  There
is a third assumption, not however of a political so
much as an ethical character, which is stated with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
equal frankness and conviction&mdash;that war on an
extensive scale is necessary, from time to time, in
order to preserve the vigour of the German people
and their noble spirit.
</p>

<p>
One school of dreamers, with its gaze fixed upon
the Atlantic trade-routes, insists upon the absurdity
of resting content with a western sea-board of some
two hundred miles.  The estuaries of the Elbe and
the Weser alone are exclusively German; that of
the Ems is shared with the Dutch; while the far
more valuable harbour-mouths of the Rhine and the
Scheldt are in the possession of Holland and Belgium.
Put into plain language what this means is, that
both Holland and Belgium must be incorporated
in the German Empire; if by treaty, so much the
better for all parties concerned; but if diplomacy
should fail to accomplish the desired absorption, then
it must be brought about by war.  Nor has it been
overlooked, that in order to complete the rectification,
and to secure the keys of the Baltic, it would be
necessary to 'admit' Denmark also into the privileges
of the Germanic Empire.
</p>

<p>
Another school looks to the south-east and broods
upon the day, not far distant, when the Germans of
Austria-Hungary&mdash;a small but dominating minority
of the whole population&mdash;will be driven, by reasons
of self-defence, to seek a federal inclusion in the
Empire of the Hohenzollerns.  And it is surmised
that for somewhat similar reasons the Magyars of
Hungary will at the same time elect to throw in their
lot with Teutons rather than with Slavs.
</p>

<p>
When that day arrives, however, it is not merely
the German and Magyar territories of the Habsburg
Emperor-King which will need to be incorporated
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
in the Hohenzollern Empire, but the whole congeries
of nations which at present submits, more or less
reluctantly, to the rule of Vienna and Buda-Pest.
There must be no break-up of the empire of Francis
Joseph, no sentimental sacrifice to the mumbo-jumbos
of nationality.  The Italians of Trieste and
Fiume, the Bohemians, the Croats, the Serbs, the
Roumanians of Transylvania, and the Poles of
Galicia must all be kept together in one state, even
more firmly than they are to-day.  The Germans
of Austria will not be cordially welcomed, unless they
bring this dowry with them to the altar of imperial
union.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE AUSTRIAN DOWRY
</span>
</p>

<p>
But to clear eyes, looking into the future, more
even than this appears to be necessary.  Austria
will be required to bring with her, not merely all
her present possessions, but also her reversionary
prospects, contingent remainders, and all and sundry
her rights of action throughout the whole Balkan
peninsula, which sooner or later must either accept
the hegemony of the German Empire or submit
to annexation at the sword's point.  Advantageous
as it would be for the Fatherland to obtain great
harbours for her commerce at the head of the Adriatic,
these acquisitions might easily become valueless
in practice if some rival barred the right of entry
through the Straits of Otranto.  Salonica again,
in her snug and sheltered corner of the Aegean, is
essential as the natural entrept for the trade of
Asia Minor and the East; while there can be no
hope, until the mouths of the Danube, as well as the
Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, are firmly held, of
turning the Black Sea into a Germanic lake.
</p>

<p>
The absorption of the Balkan peninsula, involving
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
as it must the occupation of Constantinople and
European Turkey, would carry with it, as a natural
consequence, the custody of the Sultan and the
control of his Asiatic dominions.  These vast
territories which extend from Smyrna to the Caucasus,
from Syria to the Persian Gulf, from the Black Sea
to the Gulf of Aden, contain some of the richest
and most fertile tracts upon the surface of the globe.
Massacre, misrule, and oppression have indeed
converted the greater part of these regions into a state
hardly to be distinguished from the barest deserts
of Arabia.  But a culture which has lapsed through
long neglect may be reclaimed by new enterprise.
All that is required to this end is such shelter
and encouragement as a stable government would
afford.
</p>

<p>
What more suitable instrument for this beneficent
recovery than the peculiar genius of the Teuton
race?  Would not the whole world gain by the
substitution of settled order for a murderous anarchy,
of tilth and industry for a barren desolation?  The
waters of Tigris and Euphrates are still sweet.  It
needs but the energy and art of man to lead them in
channelled courses, quenching the longings of a
thirsty land, and filling the Mesopotamian waste
with the music of a myriad streams.  The doom of
Babylon is no curse eternal.  It awaits but the sword
of Siegfried to end the slumbers of two thousand
years.  Where great cities and an ancient civilisation
lie buried under drifted sand, great cities may be
raised once more, the habitations of a hardier race,
the seminaries of a nobler civilisation.
</p>

<p>
This vision, more fanciful and poetically inspired
than the rest, has already advanced some considerable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
way beyond the frontiers of dreamland.  When
the Turko-Russian War came to an end[<a id="chap0202fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn3">3</a>] the
influence of Germany at Constantinople was as nearly
as possible nil; and so long as Bismarck remained
in power, no very serious efforts were made to
increase it.  But from the date of Bismarck's dismissal[<a id="chap0202fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn4">4</a>]
down to the present day, it has been the steady aim
of German policy to control the destinies of the
Turkish Empire.  These attempts have been
persistent, and in the main successful.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE WOOING OF TURKEY
</span>
</p>

<p>
It mattered not what dubious personage or party
might happen to be in the ascendant at Stamboul,
the friendship of Germany was always forthcoming.
It was extended with an equal cordiality to Abdul
Hamid; to the Young Turks when they overthrew
Abdul Hamid; to the Reactionaries when they
overthrew the Young Turks; to the Young
Turks again when they compounded matters with
the Reactionaries.  The largesse of Berlin bankers
refreshed the empty treasuries of each despot and
camarilla in turn, so soon as proofs could be produced
of positive, or even of presumptive predominance.
At the same time the makers of armaments,
at Essen and elsewhere, looked to it, that a sufficient
portion of these generous loans was paid in kind,
and that the national gain was not confined to high
policy and high finance.  The reform of the Turkish
army was taken in hand zealously by Prussian
soldiers.  Imperial courtesies cemented the bricks
which usury, commerce, and diplomacy had laid
so well.  At a time when the late Sultan was
ill-regarded by the whole of Europe, on account of his
supposed complicity in Armenian massacres, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
magnanimity of the Kaiser took pity on the pariah,
and a visit of honour to the Bosphorus formed an
incident in the Hohenzollern pilgrimage to the
Holy Sepulchre.
</p>

<p>
The harvest of these endeavours was reaped at
a later date in the form of vast concessions for lines
of railway running through Asia Minor to the Persian
Gulf.  It is needless to enter here into a discussion
of the famous and still unsettled controversy
regarding the Baghdad route, except to say that this
project for the benefit, not merely of Turkey, but
of the whole human race, was to be realised under
German direction and according to German plans
and specifications; it was to be administered under
German control; but it was to be paid for in the main
out of the savings of England and France.
</p>

<p>
The scheme was no less bold than ingenious.  Obligations
were imposed upon Turkey which it was clearly
impossible for Turkey to discharge.  In the event
of her failure it was likely to go hard with the original
shareholders, and somewhat hard with the Sublime
Porte itself; but on the other hand it was not likely
to go hard with Germany, or to involve her in
anything more irksome than a labour of love&mdash;a
protectorate over Asia Minor and Arabia.[<a id="chap0202fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
These are the main dreams which German writers,
with a genuine enthusiasm and an engaging frankness,
have set out in the pages of books and periodicals&mdash;the
North Sea dream, the Austrian dream, the
Balkan dream, and the Levantine dream.  But
these dreams by no means exhaust the Teuton
fancy.
</p>

<p>
Wars are contemplated calmly as inevitable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
incidents in the acquisition of world-power&mdash;war
with France, war with England, war either of army
corps or diplomacy with Belgium, Holland, and
Denmark.  And as victory is also contemplated, just
as confidently, various bye-products of considerable
value are likely to be secured during the process,
and as a result.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ACQUISITION OF AFRICA
</span>
</p>

<p>
The greater part of north-western Africa, which
lies along the seaboards of the Mediterranean and
the Atlantic, is under the French flag.  The greater
part of eastern Africa from Alexandria to Capetown
is in the hands of the British.  The central region of
Africa is Belgian.  In the north there is Tripoli
which is now Italian; and in various quarters patches
and scattered islands which are Portuguese.  The
former might be tolerated as a harmless enclave;
the latter might readily be acquired by compulsory
purchase.  What would then remain of the Dark
Continent is already German.  So that, as the results
of the wars and victories which are considered by
German thinkers to be inevitable, the whole of
Africa would shortly pass into German hands.
</p>

<p>
With the destinies of Africa in the keeping of
a virile race, accustomed to face great problems in
no piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, vast
transformations must ensue.  Before their indomitable
will and scientific thoroughness, the dusky savage
will lay aside his ferocity, and toil joyously at the
arts of peace.  Under an indefatigable and intelligent
administration, desert, jungle, forest, and
swamp will yield their appropriate harvests.  Timber,
oil, cotton, rubber, tea, coffee, and every variety of
raw material will gradually become available in
limitless supplies.  Jewels and precious metals will
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
be dug out of the bowels of the earth.  Flocks and
herds will roam in safety over the rich uplands&mdash;no
robber bands to drive them off; no wild beasts to
tear them limb from limb; no murrain or envenomed
fly to strike them down by tens of thousands.  For
as the armies of the Kaiser are invincible against
all human foes, so also are his men of science
invincible, in their ceaseless war against disease of man
and beast.  In the end they also will conquer in
their own sphere, no less certainly than the soldier
in his; for their courage is as high and their
devotion faces death, or worse than death, with
equanimity.
</p>

<p>
The Dark Continent, which in all its history has
never known either peace or order, will then at last
know both.  Even the stiff-necked Africander,
jealous of his antique shibboleths of freedom, will
not refuse incorporation in an Empire to which the
land of his forefathers will already have become bound
in federal ties.  And the dowry which Holland is
expected to bring with her, will be not only the good
will of the South African Dutch, but the rich islands
of the East, where merchant-adventurers planted
her flag, in days when the fleets of Rotterdam
disputed, not unsuccessfully, with London herself the
primacy of the seas.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE EASTERN DREAM
</span>
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is the dream of the farthest East.
This is of such simple grandeur that it may be stated
in a few sentences.  When the war between China
and Japan came to an end in 1895 Germany, acting
in concert with France and Russia, forced the
victorious troops of the Mikado to forgo all the fruits of
their conquest.  When three years later Germany
herself seized upon the reversion of Kiao-Chau, she
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
saw a vision of an empire, greater than that which
had been secured to her envied rival by the daring of
Clive and the forethought of Warren Hastings.  If
England could hold and rule India, a mightier than
England could surely hold and rule China, containing
though it does a full quarter of the human race.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
THE GERMAN PROJECT OF EMPIRE
</h3>

<p>
The German project of empire is a gorgeous fabric.
The weft of it is thread of gold, but the warp of it
has been dipped in the centaur's blood.  It is the
pride of its possessor; but it is likely to be his
undoing.  It ravishes his fancy with the symmetry
and vastness of the pattern; yet these very two
qualities, which so much excite his admiration, have
shown themselves in the past singularly unpropitious
to high imperial adventures.
</p>

<p>
No man of action worthy of the name will ever
take history for his guide.  He would rightly refuse
to do so, even were it possible, which it is not, to
write history truthfully.  But with all their deficiencies,
history books have certain sibylline qualities
which make them worth consulting upon occasions;
and as to symmetry and vastness this oracle, if
consulted, would speak clearly enough.  Of all false
enticements which have lured great princes to their
ruin, these two have the biggest tale of victims to
their score.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
SYMMETRY AND VASTNESS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The British Empire, like the Roman, built itself
slowly.  It was the way of both nations to deal
with needs as needs occurred, and not before.  Neither
of them charted out their projects in advance,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
thereafter working to them, like Lentre, when he laid
out the gardens of Versailles.  On the contrary, a
strip was added here, a kingdom there, as time went
on, but not in accordance with any plan or system.
In certain cases, no doubt, the reason for annexation
was a simple desire for possession.  But much
more often the motive was apprehension of one kind
or another.  Empire-builders have usually achieved
empire as an accident attending their search after
security&mdash;security against the ambition of a
neighbour, against lawless hordes which threaten the
frontier, against the fires of revolution and disorder
spreading from adjacent territories.  Britain, like
Rome before her, built up her empire piecemeal;
for the most part reluctantly; always reckoning up
and dreading the cost, labour, and burden of it;
hating the responsibility of expansion, and shouldering
it only when there seemed to be no other course
open to her in honour or safety.  Symmetry did not
appeal to either of these nations any more than
vastness.  Their realms spread out and extended, as
chance and circumstances willed they should, like
pools of water in the fields when floods are out.
</p>

<p>
We cannot but distrust the soundness of recent
German policy, with its grandiose visions of universal
empire, if we consider it in the light of other things
which happened when the world was somewhat
younger, though possibly no less wise.  The great
imaginative conquerors, though the fame of their
deeds still rings down the ages, do not make so brave
a show, when we begin to examine into the
permanency of their achievements.  The imperial
projects of Alexander, of the Habsburgs, the Grand
Monarque, and Napoleon&mdash;each of whom drew out
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
a vast pattern and worked to it&mdash;are not among those
things which can be said with any justice to have
endured.  None of them were ever fully achieved;
while some were broken in pieces, even during the
lifetimes of their architects.
</p>

<p>
To treat the whole world as if it were a huge
garden, for which one small race of men, who have
worked busily in a single corner of it, can aspire to
make and carry out an all-comprehending plan, is
in reality a proof of littleness and not largeness of
mind.  Such vaulting ambitions are the symptoms
of a dangerous disease, to be noted and distrusted.
And none ever noted these tendencies more carefully
or distrusted them more heartily than the two greatest
statesmen whom Prussia has produced.  Frederick
the Great rode his own Pegasus-vision on curb and
martingale.  The Great Bismarck reined back the
Pegasus-vision of his fellow-countrymen on to its
haunches with an even sterner hand.  "One
cannot," so he wrote in later years&mdash;"one cannot see
the cards of Providence so closely as to anticipate
historical development according to one's own
calculation."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MASTERY OF THE WORLD
</span>
</p>

<p>
Those very qualities of vastness and symmetry
which appear to have such fatal attraction for the
pedantocracy repel the practical statesman; and
woe to the nation which follows after the former
class rather than the latter, when the ways of the
two part company!  To the foreign observer it
seems as if Germany, for a good many years past,
has been making this mistake.  Perhaps it is her
destiny so to do.  Possibly the reigns of Frederick
and Bismarck were only interludes.  For Germany
followed the pedantocracy during a century or more,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
while it preached political inaction and contentment
with a shorn and parcelled Fatherland.  She was
following it still, when Bismarck turned constitutionalism
out of doors and went his own stern way to
union.  And now once again she seems to be marching
in a fatal procession after the same Pied Pipers,
who this time are engaged, with a surpassing
eloquence and fervour, in preaching discontent with
the narrow limits of a united empire, and in exhorting
their fellow-countrymen to proceed to the Mastery
of the World.
</p>

<p>
Among an imaginative race like the Germans,
those who wield the weapons of rhetoric and fancy
are only too likely to get the better of those surer
guides, who know from hard experience that the
world is a diverse and incalculable place, where no
man, and no acre of land, are precisely the same as
their next-door neighbours, where history never
repeats itself, and refuses always&mdash;out of malice or
disdain&mdash;to travel along the way which ingenious
Titans have charted for it.  But it is not every
generation which succeeds in producing a Frederick
the Great or a Bismarck, to tame the dreamers and
use them as beasts of draught and burden.
</p>

<p>
The complete mosaic of the German vision is an
empire incomparably greater in extent, in riches,
and in population, than any which has yet existed
since the world first began to keep its records.
Visionaries are always in a hurry.  This stupendous
rearrangement of the Earth's surface is confidently
anticipated to occur within the first half of the
present century.  It is to be accomplished by a
race distinguished for its courage, industry, and
devotion,&mdash;let us admit so much without grudging.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
But in numbers&mdash;even if we count the Teutons of
the Habsburg Empire along with those of the
Hohenzollern&mdash;it amounts upon the highest computation
to less than eighty millions.  This is the grain of
mustard-seed which is confidently believed to have
in it 'the property to get up and spread,' until
within little more than a generation, it will dominate
and control more than seven hundred millions of
human souls.
</p>

<p>
Nor to German eyes, which dwell lovingly, and
apparently without misgiving, upon this appalling
prospect of symmetry and vastness, are these the
sum total of its attractions.  The achievement of
their vision would bring peace to mankind.  For
there would then be but two empires remaining,
which need give the overlords of the world the smallest
concern.  Of these Russia, in their opinion, needs a
century at least in which to emerge out of primitive
barbarism and become a serious danger; while in
less than a century, the United States must inevitably
crumble to nonentity, through the worship of false
gods and the corruption of a decadent democracy.
Neither of these two empires could ever hope to
challenge the German Mastery of the World.
</p>

<p>
In South America as in North, there is already
a German garrison, possessing great wealth and
influence.  And in the South, at any rate, it may well
become, very speedily, an imperative obligation on
the Fatherland to secure, for its exiled children, more
settled conditions under which to extend the
advantages of German commerce and Kultur.  President
Monroe has already been dead a hundred years or
more.  According to the calculations of the pedantocracy,
his famous doctrine will need some stronger
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
backing than the moral disapprobation of a hundred
millions of materially-minded and unwarlike people, in
order to withstand the pressure of German diplomacy,
if it should summon war-ships and transports to its
aid.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
UNIVERSAL PEACE
</span>
</p>

<p>
So in the end we arrive at an exceedingly strange
conclusion.  For that very thing, which the
philanthropists have all these years been vainly
endeavouring to bring about by means of congresses
of good men, and resolutions which breathe a
unanimity of noble aspirations, may be achieved in a
single lifetime by a series of bold strokes with the
German sword.  Then at last Universal Peace will
have been secured.
</p>

<p>
At this point the Prussian professor and the
pacifist apostle, who turned their backs upon one
another so angrily at the beginning, and started off,
as it seemed, in opposite directions, are confronting
one another unexpectedly at the other side of the
circle of human endeavour.  They ought surely to
shake hands; for each, if he be honest, will have
to own himself the convert of the other.  "You
admit then after all," cries the triumphant Pacifist,
"that Peace is the real end of human endeavour!"  "Whether
or no," grunts the other in reply, "this
at any rate was the only road to it."
</p>

<p>
One wonders&mdash;will the Pacifist be content?  He
has reached his goal sure enough; though by means
which he has been accustomed to denounce as the
end of all true morality?  Will the Professor, on the
other hand, be well pleased when he discovers that
by the very triumph of his doctrines he has made
war for ever impossible,&mdash;manliness, therefore, and
all true virtue likewise impossible,&mdash;thereby damning
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
the souls of posterity to the end of time?  "To put
questions in this quarter with a hammer, and to
hear perchance that well-known hollow sound
which tells of blown-out frogs"[<a id="chap0203fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn1">1</a>]&mdash;this is a joy,
no doubt; and it is all we are ever likely to arrive
at by the cross-examination of dreamers.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
THE NEW MORALISTS
</h3>

<p>
The dream of German expansion, as year by year
it took firmer hold upon the popular imagination,
produced, as might have been expected, a desire
that it might be realised.  From the stage of vague
and ardent longing it was but a short way to the next,
where a determined will began to put forth efforts
towards achievement.  But as mankind in the mass,
whether in Germany or England, is still to some
extent hampered by human nature, by a number
of habits, traditions, and instincts, and by various
notions of good and evil, justice and injustice&mdash;which
the subtlest philosophers and most eloquent rhetoricians
have not yet succeeded in eradicating&mdash;a need
was felt for what the text-books in their solemn
nomenclature call <i>an ethical basis</i>.  In plain words,
the German people wanted to have right on their
side&mdash;if possible, old-fashioned, Sunday-school,
copy-book Right.  Failing that, even such a plea as the
wolf maintained against the lamb would be a great
deal better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
This tendency in a nation to look about for justification
and a righteous plea, when it is preparing to
possess itself of property belonging to its neighbours,
is for the most part a subconscious process, not only
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
among the common people, but also among the
leaders themselves.  It resembles the instinct among
hens which produces in them an appetite for lime
when the season has come to begin laying.  It was
through some natural impulse of this sort, and not
through mere cynicism, hypocrisy, or cool calculation,
that German publicists discovered all the grievances
which have been already touched upon.  For even
if the possession of these grievances did not altogether
give the would-be aggressors right up to the point of
righteousness, it certainly put their neighbours in the
wrong, and branded the French dove and the British
lamb with turpitude in the eyes of the German people.
The grievances against France were, that although
she had been vanquished in 1870, although her
population had actually decreased since that date, and
although therefore she had neither the right to nor any
need for expansion, she had nevertheless expanded in
Africa as well as in the East, to a far greater extent
than Germany herself, the victorious power, whose
own population had meanwhile been increasing by
leaps and bounds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GRIEVANCES AGAINST ENGLAND
</span>
</p>

<p>
The grievances against Britain were that she
was supposed to have made war upon German trade,
to have prevented her young rival from acquiring
colonies, and to have intrigued to surround the
Teuton peoples with a ring of foes.  Britain had
helped France to occupy and hold her new territories.
Britain had been mainly responsible for the
diplomatic defeat of Germany at Algeciras in 1905 and
again over Agadir in 1911.  Moreover when Germany,
during the South African war, had attempted, in the
interests of international morality, to combine the
nations against us, we had foiled her high-minded
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
and unselfish endeavours.  When at an earlier date
she had sought, by the seizure of Kiao-Chau and
by a vigorous concentration, to oust British influence
and trade from their position of predominance in
China, we had countered her efforts by the occupation
of Wei-hai-wei and the Japanese alliance.
</p>

<p>
As regards command of the sea we had likewise
frustrated German ambitions.  After a certain amount
of vacillation, and a somewhat piteous plea for a
general diminution of armaments&mdash;backed up by
an arrest of our own, which Germany interpreted,
perhaps not unnaturally, as a throwing up of the
sponge and beginning of the end of our naval
supremacy&mdash;we had actually had the treachery (for it
was nothing less) to upset all her calculations, and
turn all her efforts and acceleration to foolishness,
by resuming the race for sea-power with redoubled
energy.  And although to our own eyes, and even
possibly to the eyes of impartial observers, none of
these doings of ours&mdash;in so far as they were truly
alleged&mdash;could be rightly held to constitute any real
grievance, that consideration was irrelevant.  For
when a man is in search of a grievance he will find
it, if he be earnest enough, in the mere fact that his
intended adversary stammers, or has a wart upon
his nose.
</p>

<p>
German statesmen were happy in having established
these grievances to their own satisfaction;
but something more was necessary in order that their
morality might rest upon a sure foundation.  German
policy must be absolutely right, and not merely
relatively right by contrast with those neighbours
whose power she sought to overthrow, and whose
territories she wished to annex.  And although this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
effort to establish German policy on the principle
of Right involved a recasting of Christian morality,
it was not shirked on that account.  On the
contrary it was undertaken in a most energetic spirit.
</p>

<p>
The first great influence in this readjustment
of popular conceptions of right and wrong was
the historian Heinrich von Treitschke.[<a id="chap0204fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn1">1</a>]  He boldly
differentiated the moral obligations of the private
individual from those of a government charged with
the destinies of a nation.[<a id="chap0204fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn2">2</a>]  The duties of a man to
his family, neighbours, and society Treitschke left
undisturbed.  In this sphere of human life the
teaching of the Sermon on the Mount not only
remained unchallenged, but was upheld and reinforced.
Statecraft, however, fell under a different category.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE STATE IS POWER
</span>
</p>

<p>
The true principle of private conduct was Love
for one's Neighbour, but the true principle of the
state was Power.  The duty of a virtuous ruler was
to seek power, more power, and always more power,
on behalf of the nation he was called upon to govern.
The internal power of the state over the action of its
own subjects was absolute, and it was a duty owed
by each generation of rulers to posterity, to see to
it that in their own time, the external power of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
state was increased at the expense of its neighbours.[<a id="chap0204fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn3">3</a>]  To
secure this end wars were inevitable; and despite
the sufferings which wars entailed, they were far from
regrettable, for the reason that they preserved the
vigour, unity, and devotion of the race, while stimulating
the virtues of courage and self-sacrifice among
private citizens.[<a id="chap0204fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
Nations, he maintained, cannot safely stand
still.  They must either increase their power or lose
it, expand their territories or be prepared to see them
shorn away.  No growth of spiritual force or material
well-being within the state will preserve it, if it fails
to extend its authority and power among its neighbours.
Feelings of friendliness, chivalry, and pity
are absurd as between nations.  To speak even of
justice in such a connection is absurd.  Need and
Might together constitute Right.  Nor ought the
world to regret the eating-up of weak nations by the
strong, of small nations by the great, because&mdash;a
somewhat bold conclusion&mdash;great and powerful
nations alone are capable of producing what the
world requires in thought, art, action, and virtue.
For how can these things flourish nobly in a timid,
cowering state, which finds itself driven by force
of circumstances to make-believes and fictions, to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
the meanest supplications and to devices of low
cunning, in order to preserve an independence which,
as it can only exist on sufferance, is nothing better
than a sham?[<a id="chap0204fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
As the Hohenzollerns, the noblest and most capable
of modern dynasties, had never been content merely
to reign, but had always maintained their 'divine
right' of ruling and dominating the Prussian
Kingdom&mdash;as Prussia itself, the most manly and energetic
of modern nations, had not been content merely to
serve as the figurehead of a loose confederation, but
had insisted upon becoming supreme master and
imposing its own system, policy, and ideals upon
all Germany&mdash;so was it the duty and destiny of united
Germany, under these happy auspices, having been
taught and seasoned by long centuries of stern and
painful apprenticeship, to issue forth in the meridian
vigour of her age and seize upon the Mastery of the
World.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
</span>
</p>

<p>
If Treitschke, the eloquent historian, succeeded
to his own satisfaction and that of a very large
proportion of German statesmen, soldiers, intellectuals,
and publicists in taking high policy altogether out of
the jurisdiction of Christian morals, Friedrich Wilhelm
Nietzsche,[<a id="chap0204fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn6">6</a>] the even more eloquent and infinitely
more subtle poet-philosopher, made a cleaner and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
bolder cut, and got rid of Christian morality even in
the sphere of private conduct.
</p>

<p>
Nietzsche was but little interested or concerned
in the practical problems of statecraft which engrossed
the patriotic mind of Treitschke.  The destinies of
the German nation were for him a small matter in
comparison with those of the human race.  But
nevertheless his vigorously expressed contempt for
the English, their ways of life and thought, the
meanness of their practical aims, and the degradation
of their philosophic ideals,[<a id="chap0204fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn7">7</a>] was comforting to his
fellow-countrymen, who were relieved to find that the
nation whom they desired to despoil was so despicable
and corrupt.  This train of argument was deceptive
and somewhat dangerous; for it led his German
readers to overlook the fact, that the broad front
of his attack aimed at enveloping and crushing the
cherished traditions of the Teuton race no less than
those of the Anglo-Saxon.[<a id="chap0204fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn8">8</a>]

<p>
Nietzsche's derision and dislike of the Prussian
spirit, of militarism, and of what he conceived to
be the spurious principle of nationality, his vague,
disinterested cosmopolitanism or Europeanism, are as
the poles apart from the aims and ideas of Treitschke
and the German patriots.[<a id="chap0204fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn9">9</a>]  Nietzsche is not concerned
to evolve a sovereign and omnipotent state, but a
high overmastering type of man, who shall inherit
the earth and dominate&mdash;not for their good, but for
his own&mdash;the millions who inhabit it.  His ideal is
a glorious aristocracy of intellect, beauty, courage,
self-control, felicity, and power, scornfully smiling,
exuberantly vital.  The evolution, ever higher and
higher, of this fine oligarchy of super-men is the one
absolute end of human endeavour.  The super-men
will use and direct the force and instincts of 'the
herd'&mdash;even the capacities of kings, soldiers, law-givers,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
and administrators&mdash;to make the world a fit
place for their own development.  The millions of
slaves are to be considered merely as a means to this
end.  Concern about them for their own sakes, above
all pity for their sufferings, or regard on the part of
the super-men for their resentment&mdash;except to guard
against it&mdash;is a mistake.  The serenity of the
superman must not allow itself to be disturbed and
distracted by any such considerations.  It is for him
to take what he needs or desires, to impose order
on the world, so that it may be a fit environment for
the evolution of his own caste, and, so far as he can
compass it, to live like the gods.[<a id="chap0204fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE BLONDE BRUTE
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is clear that although Nietzsche chaunts a pan
in admiration of "the magnificent blonde brute,
avidly rampant for spoil and victory,"[<a id="chap0204fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn11">11</a>] and although
he is constantly found, as it were, humming this
refrain, he had no intention of taking the Prussian
as his ideal type&mdash;still less of personifying Prussia
itself as a super-state engaged in a contest for
supremacy with a herd of inferior nations.  He does
not trouble himself in the least about nations, but
only about individual men.  Yet, like others who
have had the gift of memorable speech, he might
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
well marvel, were he still alive, at the purposes
to which his words have been turned by orators and
journalists, desirous to grind an edge on their own
blunt axes.
</p>

<p>
General von Bernhardi[<a id="chap0204fn12text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn12">12</a>] may be taken as a type
of the sincere but unoriginal writer who turns all
texts to the support of his own sermon.  He is an
honest, literal fellow.  In spite of all his ecstatic
flights of rhetoric he is never at all in the
clouds&mdash;never any farther from the earth's surface than
hopping distance.  Notwithstanding, he quietly
appropriates any Nietzschean aphorisms the sound and
shape of which appear to suit his purpose, and uses
them to drive home his very simple and concrete
proposition that it is the duty of Germany to conquer
the world.
</p>

<p>
One imagines from his writings that Bernhardi
has no quarrel with Christianity, no wish whatsoever
to overturn our accepted notions of morality.  He
is merely a soldier with a fixed idea, and he is very
much in earnest.  His literary methods remind one
somewhat of the starlings in spring-time, perched on
the backs of sheep and cattle, picking off the loose
hairs to line their nests.  This is the highly practical
and soldierly use to which he puts philosophers,
poets, and men of letters generally&mdash;laying them under
contribution to garnish his discourse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
INFLUENCE OF PHILOSOPHY
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is probably true that the average soldier who
fought on the German side at Ypres and elsewhere
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
was hardly more conversant with the writings of
Treitschke, Nietzsche, and Bernhardi than the
average British soldier opposed to him was with those
of Herbert Spencer, Mr. Bernard Shaw, and Mr. Norman
Angell.  It is very unlikely, however, that
the battle of Ypres would ever have been fought had
it not been for the ideas which sprang from these
and similar sources.  The influence of the written
and spoken word upon German policy and action is
glaringly manifest.[<a id="chap0204fn13text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn13">13</a>]  It inspired and supported the
high bureaucrats at Berlin, and had equally to do,
if indirectly, with the marching of the humblest raw
recruits shoulder to shoulder to be shot down on the
Menin Road.  For by a process of percolation through
the press and popular literature, the doctrines of
these teachers&mdash;diluted somewhat, it is true, and a
good deal disguised and perverted&mdash;had reached a
very wide audience.  Though the names of these
authors were for the most part unknown, though
their opinions had never been either understood or
accepted by the common people, the effects of their
teaching had made themselves felt in every home in
Germany.
</p>

<p>
The German private soldier would not have been
shot down unless these eloquent sermons had been
preached.  None the less, he had never grasped or
understood, far less had he adhered to and professed,
the cardinal doctrines which they contained.  He
still believed in the old-fashioned morality, and
thought that states as well as individual men were
bound to act justly.  It was this faith which gave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
him his strength, and made him die gladly.  For he
believed that Germany had acted justly, the Allies
unjustly, that it was his task, along with other good
men and true, to win victory for his Emperor and
safety for his Fatherland, and to crush the
treacherous and malignant aggressors.
</p>

<p>
In spite of all this preliminary discoursing which
had been going on for many years past, like artillery
preparation before an infantry attack&mdash;about world-power,
will-to-power, and all the rest of it&mdash;nothing
is more remarkable than the contrast presented,
immediately after war broke out, between the blatancy
of those writers who had caused the war and the
bleating of those (in many cases the same) who
sought to justify Germany's part in it to their
countrymen and the world.
</p>

<p>
On the enlightened principles of Treitschke and
Bernhardi, Britain would have acted not only wisely,
but in the strictest accordance with her duty to her
own state, had she indeed contrived and compassed
this war, believing circumstances to be favourable
for herself and unfavourable for Germany.  Not
another shred of right or reason was required.[<a id="chap0204fn14text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn14">14</a>]  But
when war actually burst out, all these new-fangled
doctrines went by the board.  Though the ink was
hardly dry upon Bernhardi's latest exhortation&mdash;of
which several hundred thousand copies had been
sold, and in which he urged his fellow-countrymen
to watch their time and make war when it suited
them, without remorse and no matter on what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
plea&mdash;in spite of this fact, there was a singular lack of
Stoicism among 'the brethren' when war was declared
against Russia and France.  When Britain joined in,
and when things began to go less well than had been
expected, Stoicism entirely disappeared.  Indeed
there is something highly ludicrous, at the same
time painful&mdash;like all spectacles of human
abasement&mdash;in the chorus of whines and shrill execration,
which at once went up to heaven from that very
pedantocracy whose leaders, so short a time before,
had been preaching that, as between the nations of
the earth, Might is Right, and Craft is the trusty
servant of Might.[<a id="chap0204fn15text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
APOSTASY WHEN WAR CAME
</span>
</p>

<p>
These scolding fakirs were of an infinite credulity,
inasmuch as they believed that Sir Edward Grey
was the reincarnation of Machiavelli.  Yet on their
own principles, what was there in this discovery to
be in the least shocked at?  British statesmen (it
is hardly necessary to repeat it) had not walked in
the footsteps of the Florentine; had not provoked
the war; had not wished for it; had tried with all
their might to prevent it; but if they had done the
very reverse, would they not merely have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
taking a leaf out of the sacred book of the
pedantocracy&mdash;out of Bernhardi's book, out of Nietzsche's
book, out of Treitschke's book?  Why, then, all
these unpleasant howlings and ravings?
</p>

<p>
The answers are not hard to find.  The careful
plans and theories of the German bureaucrats had been
turned topsy-turvy because England had joined in the
war when, according to the calculations of the augurs,
she should have remained neutral.  That mistake
must have been sufficiently annoying in itself to
disturb the equanimity even of professional philosophers.
And further, in spite of all the ingenious, eloquent,
and sophistical exhortations of the prophets, the
old morality still kept its hold upon the hearts
of men.  When trouble arose they turned to it
instinctively&mdash;priesthood as well as people&mdash;and
the later gospel fell flat like a house of cards.
Immediately war came there was an appeal to
old-fashioned justice, and the altars of the little,
new-fangled, will-to-power gods were deserted by
their worshippers.
</p>

<p>
When statesmen are laying out policies, and
moralists are setting up systems, it is worth their
while to make certain that they are not, in fact,
engaged upon an attempt to make water flow uphill;
above all, that their ingenious new aqueducts will
actually hold water, which in this instance they
certainly did not.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
THE STATECRAFT OF A PRIESTHOOD
</h3>

<p>
The thoroughness and efficiency of the Germans are
admitted even by hostile critics.  In the practical
sphere they have excelled in military preparations,
in the encouragement of industry, and in the
organisation of finance.  But they have achieved an even
more remarkable success than any of these; for
they have so arranged their educational system that
it is drilled hardly less admirably than their army.[<a id="chap0205fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn1">1</a>]  From
the primary schools to the universities everything
is ordered, so that the plastic mind of youth is
forced into a political mould which suits the purposes
of government.  Patriotism of the pattern approved
by the authorities is inculcated directly or indirectly
in every class-room.  While thought is left
ostentatiously free in regard to private morals and
religious foundations, the duties of the citizen to the
state, the duties of the state to posterity, the relations
of Germany to the outside world, are subjects upon
which independent speculation is not tolerated.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
</p>

<p>
Even schoolmasters and professors have their
ambitions; but unless they contribute their quota
to the support of imperial ideals, their careers are
unlikely to prosper.  It is not enough that a lecturer
should not run counter to state policy; he must
actively promote its ends before he can hope to be
transferred to a sphere of greater dignity and
influence.  Pedagogy is a branch of the Civil Service
just as much as the Treasury or the Public Health
Department.  Teachers from the lowest to the highest
grades are the stipendiaries of the bureaucracy.  If
they render useful services they are promoted.  If
they fail to render useful services they are passed
over.  If they indulge in dangerous speculations
they are sent adrift.  Not merely the army, but the
whole German nation, is disciplined, during the
period of its impressionable youth, with the object
of inclining its mind to support state policy through
thick and thin.
</p>

<p>
The schools feed the universities; the universities
feed the press, the learned professions, and the
higher grades in industry and finance.  Private
conversation, as well as what is published in
newspapers, magazines, and books, bears the impress of
the official mint to a degree unthinkable in England
or America, Russia or France.  Theories of politics
are devised by ingenious sophists, exactly as the
machinery at Essen is contrived by engineers&mdash;for the
express purpose of forwarding Prussian policy.
History is twisted and distorted in order to prepare
the way for imperial ambitions by justifying them
in advance.
</p>

<p>
It is a signal triumph for the thoroughness of
German methods that all the thinkers, dreamers,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
poets, and prophets, with but a few exceptions,
should have been commandeered and set to work
thinking, dreaming, poetising, and prophesying to
the glory of the Kaiser, and his army, and his
navy, and his counsellors, and his world policy, and
the conquests and expansion which are entailed
therein.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MOBILISATION OF INTELLECTUALS
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is somewhat startling, however, to find the
intellectuals thus mobilised, and all but unanimous, on
the official side; for hitherto in history they have
rarely agreed among themselves, and the greater part
have usually favoured the Opposition rather than the
Government.  Nor does this close alliance between
learning and the bureaucracy seem altogether
satisfactory.  For thought loses its fine edge when it is
set to cut millstones of state.  It loses its fine temper
in the red heat of political controversy.  By turning
utilitarian it ceases to be universal; and what is
perhaps even worse, it ceases to be free.  It tends
more and more to become the mere inventor of
things which will sell at a profit; less and less the
discoverer of high principles which the gods have
hidden out of sight.  It would hardly be possible
to imagine a more complete reversal of attitude
than that which has occurred in Germany between
the beginning of the nineteenth century and the
present time; and though this change may serve
admirably the immediate purposes of the state, it
does not augur well for the future of German thought.
</p>

<p>
The similarities and contrasts of history are
interesting to contemplate.  In the ferment of thought
and action which occurred in France during the
generation preceding the battle of Valmy, and that
other which has been going on in Germany in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
generation preceding the battle of the Marne, there
are various likenesses and unlikenesses.
In France before the Revolution, as in Germany
to-day, a bureaucracy, responsible solely to the
monarch, directed policy and controlled administration.
But in France this bureaucracy was incompetent,
unpractical, and corrupt.  Its machinery
was clogged with dead matter of every kind, with
prejudices, traditions, and statutes, many of which
had outlived their original purposes.  The
<i>Struldbrugs</i>, discovered by Gulliver during his voyages,
were a race of men whose mortal souls were incased
in immortal bodies.  The French monarchy was of
this nature, and the soul of it was long since dead.
Inefficiency was everywhere apparent; and, as a
natural consequence, the whole system had become
a butt, at which each brilliant writer in turn levelled
his darts of derision and contempt.
</p>

<p>
In Germany, although the political mechanism
is the same, the conditions are diametrically the
opposite.  The bureaucracy and the monarchy which
it supports, have proved themselves highly efficient
and adaptive.  The arrangement has worked with
a marvellous success.  It has cherished the material,
if not the spiritual, well-being of the people.  The
wealth-producing and belly-filling activities of the
race have been stimulated to an extent never yet
attained by any form of government, either popular
or despotic.  Administration has been honest, thrifty,
and singularly free from the usual dull negatives of
officialdom and the pedantries of red tape.  In all
directions industrial prosperity has increased, under
the fostering care of the state, by leaps and bounds.
Anything more remote from the bankrupt empire of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
Louis XVI. it would be impossible to conceive.  And
as a natural consequence, brilliant German writers
have for the most part[<a id="chap0205fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn2">2</a>] spent their forces of rhetoric
and fancy in idealising the grandeur and nobility of
an order of things, under which resources, comfort,
and luxury have expanded with such amazing strides.

<span class="sidenote">
IDEAS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the case of France the aim of the intellectuals
was to pull down existing institutions, in that of
Germany it has been to bolster them up, to extend
and develop them to their logical conclusions.  But
the second were no less agents of destruction than the
first.  Each alike, as a condition of success, required
that a new order of moral and political ideas should be
set up; each attained a certain measure of success; and
the results which followed were those which usually
follow, when new wine is poured into old bottles.
</p>

<p>
The ideas of the French Revolution cast themselves
into the mould of republicanism.  A picture
wholly imaginary and fictitious was drawn of the
institutions of Greece and Rome in ancient days.
<i>Liberty</i>, <i>Equality</i>, and <i>Fraternity</i> were believed to
have been the foundations of these famous states.
Patriots on the banks of the Seine conceived
themselves to be re-incarnations of Aristides and the
Gracchi, of Pericles, of one Brutus or the other&mdash;it
mattered little which.  Political idealism passed
rapidly into a kind of religious fervour.
</p>

<p>
The German masquerade is very different from this,
but it is no less a masquerade.  What covers the new
faith, indeed, is not plumage borrowed from the Greeks
and Romans, but habiliments which are supposed
to have clad the heroic forms of ancestral Teutons.
The student on his way to doctor's degree&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
intelligent clerk scanning the high-road to fortune
from the eminence of office-stool&mdash;dream in their
pensive leisure to emulate the heroes of Asgard, to
merit and enjoy the glories of Valhalla.  But the
noble shapes and gorgeous colourings in which the
modern young German of honest, sober, and
industrious character has chosen to see his destiny
prefigured, are no less imaginary and fictitious than
those others, with which eloquent notaries'-clerks,
and emancipated, unfrocked priests, decked
themselves out for the admiration of the Paris mob.  In
Germany as in France political idealism passed into
a kind of religious fervour, which inspired men to a
mimicry of old-Wardour-Street shams, and led them
to neglect the development of their own true natures.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During quiet times that stream of events, which
we are wont to call human progress, is occupied
incessantly in throwing up dams, of one sort or another,
throughout the world.  Tree-trunks and logs, which
have been swept down by former floods of conquest
and invasion, jam at some convenient rocky angle, as
the river falls to its normal level.  Against these
obstacles the drift and silt of habit, custom, law,
convention, prejudice, and tradition slowly collect,
settle, and consolidate.  An embankment is gradually
formed, and the waters are held up behind it ever
higher and higher.  The tribal pool becomes a pond
or nation; and this again, if conditions remain
favourable&mdash;for so long, that is to say, as there are no
more raging and destructive floods,&mdash;extends into a
lake or inland sea of empire....  "See," cry the
optimists, "see what a fine, smooth, silvery sheet of
civilisation, culture, wealth, happiness, comfort, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
what not besides, where formerly there was but an
insignificant torrent brawling in the gorge!" ... But
the pessimists, as is their nature, shake their
heads, talk anxiously of the weight of waters which
are banking up behind, and of the unreliable character
of the materials out of which the dam has grown.
"Some day," they warn us, "the embankment
will burst under the heavy pressure; or, more likely
still, some ignorant, heedless, or malicious person
will begin to fiddle and tamper with the casual
structure; and then what may we expect?"

<span class="sidenote">
RECENT ANXIETIES
</span>
</p>

<p>
There has been considerable nervousness of late
among rulers of nations as to the soundness of their
existing barrages.  For the most part, however, they
have concerned themselves with internal dangers&mdash;with
watching propagandists of the socialist
persuasion&mdash;with keeping these under a kind of benevolent
police supervision, and in removing ostentatiously
from time to time the more glaring of their alleged
grievances.  This procedure has been quite as noticeable
in the case of autocracies, as in countries which
enjoy popular institutions.
</p>

<p>
Treitschke and Bernhardi&mdash;even Nietzsche himself&mdash;valued
themselves far more highly as builders-up
than as pullers-down.  It is always so with your
inspired inaugurators of change.  It was so with
Rousseau and those other writers, whose thoughts,
fermenting for a generation in the minds of Frenchmen,
brought about the Revolution.  The intellectuals
of the eighteenth century, like those of the nineteenth,
aimed at getting rid of a great accumulation of
insanitary rubbish.  But this was only a troublesome
preliminary, to be hurried through with as
quickly as possible, in order that the much greater
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
work of construction might proceed upon the cleared
site.
</p>

<p>
Treitschke made a hole in the German dam when
he cut an ancient commonplace in two, and tore out
the one half of it.  Nietzsche turned the hole into a
much vaster cavity by pulling out the other half.
Bernhardi and the pedantocracy worked lustily at the
business, with the result that a great part of the
sticks, stones, and mud of tradition are now dancing,
rumbling, and boiling famously in the flood.  Whether
they have injured our dam as well as their own, we
are hardly as yet in a position to judge.
</p>

<p>
The profounder spirit of Nietzsche realised clearly
enough the absurdity of supposing that the
conflicting beliefs and aspirations of mankind could all
be settled and squared in a few bustling decades&mdash;that
the contradictions, paradoxes, and antinomies
of national existence could be written off with a few
bold strokes of the sword, and the world started off
on the road to perfection, like a brisk debtor who
has purged his insolvency in the Bankruptcy Court.
But the enthusiasm of Treitschke and Bernhardi
made them blind to these considerations.  Had not
the formula been discovered, which would overcome
every obstacle&mdash;that stroke of genius, the famous
bisection of the commonplace?  For private conduct,
the Sermon on the Mount; for high statecraft,
Machiavelli's <i>Prince</i>!  Was ever anything simpler,
except perhaps the way of Columbus with the egg?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When we push our examination further, into the
means which Germany has been urged by her great
thinkers to employ in preparing for this premeditated
war, for provoking it when the season should be ripe,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
and for securing victory and spoils, we are struck
more than ever by the gulf which separates the ideas
of the German pedantocracy from those of the rest
of the world.  Nor can we fail to be impressed by
the matter-of-fact and businesslike way in which the
military and civil powers have set to work to
translate those notions into practice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A POLITICAL PRIESTHOOD
</span>
</p>

<p>
No kind of priesthood has ever yet exercised a
great and direct influence upon national policy
without producing calamity.  And by an ill fate, it has
always been the nature of these spiritual guides to
clutch at political power whenever it has come within
their reach.
</p>

<p>
Of all classes in the community who are intellectually
capable of having ideas upon public affairs, a
priesthood&mdash;or what is the same thing, a pedantocracy&mdash;is
undoubtedly the most mischievous, if it succeeds in
obtaining power.  It matters not a whit whether
they thunder forth their edicts and incitements from
church pulpits or university chairs, whether they
carry their sophistical projects up the back stairs of
Catholic King or Lutheran Kaiser, whether, having
shaved their heads and assumed vows of celibacy,
they dwell in ancient cloisters, or, having taken unto
themselves wives and begotten children, they keep
house in commonplace villa residences.  None of
these differences is essential, or much worth
considering.  The one class is as much a priesthood as
the other, and the evils which proceed from the
predominance of the one, and the other, are hardly
distinguishable.
</p>

<p>
They stand ostentatiously aloof from the sordid
competitions of worldly business.  They have forsworn,
or at any rate forgone, the ordinary prizes of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
wealth and position.  And for these very reasons
they are ill equipped for guiding practical affairs.
Their abstinences are fatal impediments, and render
them apt to leave human nature out of their reckoning.
They are wanting in experience of the difficulties
which beset ordinary men, and of the motives which
influence them.  Knowing less of such matters (for
all their book learning) than any other class of
articulately-speaking men, they find it by so much the easier
to lay down rules and regulations for the government
of the world.
</p>

<p>
To a priesthood, whether ecclesiastical or
academic, problems of politics and war present
themselves for consideration in an engaging
simplicity.  They evolve theories of how people live,
of how they ought to live; and both sets of theories
are mainly cobwebs.  There is no place in their
philosophy for anything which is illogical or untidy.
Ideas of compromise and give-and-take, are
abominations in priestly eyes&mdash;at any rate when they
are engaged in contemplation of worldly affairs.
And seeing that the priesthood aspires, nevertheless,
to govern and direct a world which is illogical and
needs humouring, there is nothing wonderful, if when
it has achieved power, it should blunder on disaster
in the name of principle, and incite men to cruelties
in the name of humanity.  'Clericalism,' said a
French statesman, and English statesmen have
echoed his words&mdash;'Clericalism is the enemy.'  And
this is right, whether the priesthood be that of Rome
or John Calvin, of economic professors expounding
Adam Smith in the interests of Manchester, or
history professors improving upon Treitschke in the
interests of the Hohenzollern dynasty.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
PRIESTS AND LAWYERS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Priests and professors when they meddle in
politics are always the same.  They sit in their
studies or cells, inventing fundamental principles;
building thereon great edifices of reasoned or
sentimental brickwork which splits in the sun and crumbles
in the storm.  Throughout the ages, as often as
they have left their proper sphere, they have been
subject to the same angry enthusiasms and savage
obstinacies.  Their errors of judgment have been
comparable only to their arrogance.  Acts of cruelty
and treachery, meanness and dishonour,[<a id="chap0205fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn3">3</a>] which would
revolt the ordinary German or Englishman,
commend themselves readily, on grounds of sophistry
or logic, to these morbid ascetics, so soon as they
begin busying themselves with the direction of public
affairs.
</p>

<p>
It would be unfair to judge any country by its
political professors.  At the same time, if any country
is so foolish as to follow such guides, there is a probability
of mischief in national&mdash;still more in international&mdash;affairs.
For they are as innocent as the lawyers
themselves, of any knowledge of the real insides of
things.  They differ of course from the lawyers in
many ways.  They are ever for making changes for
the sake of symmetry; while the man of law is for
keeping as he is until the last moment; or at any
rate until it is clearly his interest to budge.  A
priesthood has a burning faith in its own hand-wrought
idols; the lawyer on the contrary, does
not go readily to the stake, does not catch fire easily,
being rather of the nature of asbestos.  When lawyers
monopolise political power&mdash;even when they merely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
preponderate, as of late years they have seemed to
do more and more in all democratic countries,
whether of the monarchical or republican type&mdash;they
invariably destroy by insensible gradations
that which is most worth preserving in man or state,
the soul.  But they do not bring on sudden
catastrophe as a priesthood does; their method is to
strangle slowly like ivy.
</p>

<p>
In England, nowadays&mdash;indeed ever since the
'eighties, when professors of Political Economy
became discredited as political guides&mdash;there are not
many evidences of priestly influence.  Certainly there
is nothing of an organised kind.  What exists is
erratic and incalculable.  There is much clamour;
but it is contradictory, spasmodic, and inconstant,
without any serious pretence, either of learning or
science, to support it.  Each of our prophets is in
business for himself.  There is no tinge of Erastianism
about any of them.  For the most part they
are the grotesques and <i>lions comiques</i> of the
world of letters, who prophesy standing on their
heads, or grinning through horse-collars, and mistaking
always "the twinkling of their own sophisticated minds
for wisdom."
</p>

<p>
Alliance between a priesthood and a bureaucracy
tends gradually to produce, as in the case of China,
an oppressive uniformity&mdash;not unlike that aimed at
by the more advanced socialists&mdash;where every
fresh innovation is a restriction hampering the
natural bent.  On the other hand an alliance between
a priesthood and a military caste&mdash;especially when
the bureaucracy is ready to act in sympathy&mdash;is
one of the commonest causes of international
convulsions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
PRIESTS AND SOLDIERS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, the soldier, who affects to despise
men of words and make-believes, and who on this
account has an instinctive dislike and distrust of
the lawyer&mdash;so violent indeed that it often puts him
in the wrong, and leaves him at the mercy of the
object of his contempt&mdash;is dangerously apt to become
the tool of anything which bears a likeness to Peter
the Hermit.  It is not really the lawyer's confidence
in the efficacy of words which revolts the soldier,
nearly so much as the kind of words used, the
temperament of him who uses them, and the character
of the make-believes which it is sought to establish.
The unworldliness, simplicity, idealism, and fervour
of the priesthood make strong appeals to a military
caste, which on the contrary is repelled by what it
conceives to be the cynicism, opportunism, and
self-seeking of lawyer statecraft.
</p>

<p>
More especially is it difficult for the military caste
to resist the influence of the priesthood when, as in
Germany of recent years, they have insisted upon
giving the warrior the most important niche in their
temple, and on burning incense before him day and
night.  Working industriously in their studies and
laboratories they have found moral justification for
every course, however repugnant to established ideas,
which may conceivably make it easier to attain
victory and conquest.  The soldier might have
scruples about doing this or that; but when he is
assured by inspired intellectuals, that what would
best serve his military ends is also the most moral
course of action, how can he&mdash;being a man of
simple mind&mdash;presume to doubt it; though he may
occasionally shudder as he proceeds to put it into
execution?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
</p>

<p>
German thoroughness is an admirable quality,
but even thoroughness may be carried to extremes
which are absurd, or something worse.
</p>

<p>
No nation has a right to complain if another
chooses to drill armies, build fleets, accumulate stores
of treasure, weapons, and material; nor is it
incumbent upon any nation to wear its heart upon its
sleeve, or to let the whole world into its secrets,
military or political.  In so far as Germany has
acted upon these principles she was well within her
rights.  As a result we have suffered heavily; but
we must blame ourselves for being ill-prepared;
we have no justification for complaining because
Germany was well-prepared.
</p>

<p>
There are some kinds of preparation, however,
which it does not seem possible to justify, if the
world is to consist as heretofore of a large number
of independent states, between whose citizens it
is desirable to maintain a certain friendliness and
freedom of intercourse.  German activities in various
directions, for many years before war broke out,
make one wonder what state of things was contemplated
by German statesmen, as likely to prevail
when war should be over.  What, for instance,
is to be the status of Germans visiting or residing
in other countries&mdash;seeking to trade with them&mdash;to
borrow money from them&mdash;to interchange with
them the civilities of ordinary life, or those more
solemn courtesies which are practised by societies of
learning and letters?  Will the announcement <i>civis
Germanicus sum</i> be enough henceforth to secure the
stranger a warm welcome and respect?  Or will such
revelation of his origin be more likely to lead to his
speedy re-embarkation for the land of his nativity?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN AGENCIES
</span>
</p>

<p>
Spying has always been practised since the
beginning of time; but it has rarely been conducted in
such a manner as to produce general uneasiness, or
any sensible restraint upon private relations.
Logically, it would be unfair to condemn recent German
enterprises in this direction, seeing that she has only
extended an accepted nuisance on to a much vaster
scale.  But here again logic is a misleading guide.
There is something in the very scale of German
espionage which has changed the nature of this
institution.  It has grown into a huge organised
industry for the debauching of vain, weak, and greedy
natures; for turning such men&mdash;for the most part
without their being aware of it&mdash;into German agents.
The result of Teutonic thoroughness in this instance
is a domestic intrusion which is odious, as well as a
national menace which cannot be disregarded.  Many
of these hostile agencies may surely be termed
treacherous, seeing that they have aimed, under the
guise of friendly intercourse, at forwarding schemes
of invasion and conquest.
</p>

<p>
We are familiar enough with the vain purse-proud
fellow, who on the strength of a few civil speeches
from the Kaiser&mdash;breathing friendship and the love of
peace&mdash;has thenceforward flattered himself that his
mission in life was to eradicate suspicion of German
intentions from the minds of his British
fellow-countrymen.  This is the unconscious type of agent,
useful especially in sophisticated circles, and among
our more advanced politicians of anti-militarist
sympathies.
</p>

<p>
Then we have the naturalised, or unnaturalised,
magnate of finance or industry, to whom business
prosperity is the great reality of life, politics and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
patriotism being by comparison merely things of the
illusory sort.  It would cause him no very bitter
anguish of heart to see England humiliated and her
Empire dissolved, providing his own cosmopolitan
undertakings continued to thrive undisturbed by
horrid war.  He, also, has very likely been the
recipient of imperial suavities.  In addition to this,
however, he has been encouraged to imagine that
he enjoys in a peculiar degree the confidence of the
German Foreign Office.  The difficulties which so
shrewd a fellow must have in believing in the
innocence of German intentions must be considerable
at the outset; but they are worn away by the
constant erosion of his private interests.  Britain
must not cross Germany:&mdash;that is his creed in a
nutshell.  This is the semi-conscious type of agent;
and he carries great weight in business circles, and
even sometimes in circles much higher than those
frequented by the money-changers.
</p>

<p>
We may resent such influences as these, now that
we have become more or less sensible of the effect
which they have had during recent years in hindering
our preparations for defence; but here we cannot
fairly charge Germany with any breach of custom
and tradition.  We must blame ourselves for having
given heed to their counsellors.  But it is different
when we come to such things as the wholesale
corruption of the subjects of friendly nations&mdash;a network
of careful intrigue for the promotion of rebellion&mdash;lavish
subsidies and incitements for the purpose of
fostering Indian unrest, Egyptian discontent, and
South African treason&mdash;the supply of weapons and
munitions of war on the shortest notice, and most
favourable terms, to any one and every one who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
seems inclined to engage in civil war in Ireland or
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN METHODS AT WORK
</span>
</p>

<p>
The whole of this procedure has been justified
in advance and advocated in detail by Bernhardi
and the priesthood.  Belgium, France, Russia, and
Britain are doubtless peculiarly alive to the iniquity
of these practices, for the reason that their moral
judgment has been sharpened by personal suffering.
But they do not denounce the system solely because
they themselves have been injured by it, but also
because it seems to them to be totally at variance
with all recent notions regarding the comity of
nations.  If we may use such an old-fashioned term,
it appears to us to be wrong.
</p>

<p>
If methods such as these are henceforth to be
practised by the world in general, must not all
international communion become impossible, as much in
time of peace as during a war?  Indeed must not
human existence itself become almost intolerable?
Friendliness, hospitality, courtesies of every sort,
between men and women of one country and those
of another, must cease absolutely, if the world should
become a convert to these German doctrines.  Travel
must cease; for no one likes to be stripped naked
and searched at every frontier.  Trade and financial
operations must also be restricted, one would imagine,
to such an extent that ultimately they will wither
and die.
</p>

<p>
And if the world in general after the war is ended
does not become a convert to these German doctrines
of treacherous preparation, made in friendly territories
during time of peace, what then will be its attitude
towards Germany and the Germans; for they presumably
have no intention of abandoning these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
practices?  It is an unpleasant problem, but it will
have to be faced sooner or later.
</p>

<p>
For obviously, although every sensible man
believes, and many of us know by actual experience,
that the instincts of Germans, in all private
relations, are as loyal and honourable as those of most
other races which inhabit the earth, no nation can
afford any longer to have dealings with them on
equal terms, if they have decided to allow their
instincts to be used and abused, over-ridden and
perverted, by a bureaucracy whose ideal is thoroughness,
and by a priesthood which has invented a new
system of morals to serve a particular set of ends.
Not only the allied nations which are at present at war
with Germany, but any country whose interests may
conceivably, at any future time, come into conflict
with those of that far-sighted empire, will be forced
in self-defence to take due precautions.  It is clear
enough that more efficacious means than mere scraps
of naturalisation paper will be needed to secure
mankind against the abuse of its hospitality by
Teutonic theorists.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE GERMAN CREED
</span>
</p>

<p>
The whole of this strange system, those methods
which, even after somewhat painful experience of
their effects, we are still inclined in our less reflective
moments to regard as utterly incredible&mdash;is it possible
to summarise them in a few sentences?  What are
the accepted maxims, the orthodox formulas of
Prussian statecraft?
</p>

<p>
Power, more power, world-power; these according
to German theory, as well as practice, should be
the dominant principles of the state.
</p>

<p>
When a nation desires territories belonging to its
neighbours, let it take them, if it is strong enough.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
No further justification is needed than mere appetite
for possession, and the strength to satisfy it.
</p>

<p>
War is in itself a good thing and not a bad.  Like
a purge, or a course of the waters of Aix, it should be
taken, every half-century or so, by all nations which
aim at preserving the vigour of their constitutions.
</p>

<p>
During the intervening periods the chief duty of
the state is to prepare for war, so that when it
comes, victory, and with it benefits of the material,
as well as of the spiritual sort, may be secured.
</p>

<p>
No means which will help to secure victory are
immoral, whether in the years preceding the outbreak
of hostilities, or afterwards, when the war is in full
course.  If the state, aided by its men of science,
could find any safe and secret means of sending a
plague, as an advance guard, to ravage the enemy,
where is the objection?  The soul of a Prussian
soldier might revolt against this form of warfare, but
at what point would it conflict with the teachings of
the priesthood?  Nor can we imagine, were the thing
possible, that the bureaucracy would allow itself to
be hampered by any scruples.
</p>

<p>
As to the declaration of war, let it be made when
the state is in a strong position and its prey in a
weak one.  This is the all-important consideration.
The actual pretext is only a secondary matter, though
worthy of attention for the effect it may have on the
action of neutrals.  And as war is a game of chance,
it is wise and right to 'correct fortune,' so far as
this can be accomplished during years of peace and
under the cloak of amity, by the aid of spies, secret
agents, accomplices, traitors, rebels, and what not
besides.
</p>

<p>
The state which has evolved this system and laid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
down these rules, without the least attempt at secrecy
or concealment, is the most efficient machine of the
fighting and administrative kind at present existing
in the world&mdash;perhaps which has ever existed in the
world.  But as you increase the size, power, and
complexity of a machine there are obvious dangers
unless you can also increase the calibre of the men
who have to drive and direct it.  This is a much
more difficult problem than the other; and there is
no evidence to show that it has been solved in the
case of Germany.  The more powerful the machine,
the greater is apt to be the disaster if it is mishandled.
</p>

<p>
In history the blunders of bureaucracy are a
by-word.  They have been great and many, even when,
as in Germany to-day, the bureaucracy is in the full
vigour of its age, and in the first flower of uprightness;
for a bureaucracy, in order to retain its efficiency,
must remain incorruptible, and that is one of the
hardest things to secure.
</p>

<p>
As for the priesthoods, if they are to be of any use,
their faith must burn brightly.  And the faith of a
priesthood is very apt to burn itself out&mdash;very apt
also to set fire to other things during the process;
even to the edifice of popular virtue and the imperial
purple itself, which things&mdash;unlike the Phoenix, the
Salamander, and the Saint&mdash;are none the better or
stronger for being burned.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We are constantly being told by high authorities
that the moral objective of the present war is 'to
put down militarism,' and 'abolish it' off the face
of the earth.  There are few of us who do not wish
that this aim may be crowned with success; but
militarism is a tough weed to kill, and something
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
more than the mere mowing of it down by some
outside scythesman will be necessary, one imagines,
in order to get rid of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MAIN OBJECT OF THE WAR
</span>
</p>

<p>
The true moral objective of the war is something
much more important than this.  A blacker evil than
militarism is that violation of private trust and
public honour which is known as the Prussian
System, and which has recently been 'marching
through rapine, to the disintegration,' not of a single
nation, or group of nations, but of the whole fabric
of human society, including its own.  It is an
elaborate contrivance of extreme artificiality, a
strange perversion of the nature of man.  These are
its inherent weaknesses; and fortunately, by reason
of them, it is more vulnerable to hard blows than
militarism which, with all its vices, and extravagancies,
is rooted in instincts which are neither
depraved nor ignoble.
</p>

<p>
Militarism might continue to thrive under adversity,
and after the heaviest defeat, as it has done in
times past; but the life of the Prussian System&mdash;that
joint invention of the most efficient bureaucracy
in the world, and of a priesthood whose industry
can only be matched by its sycophancy and
conceit&mdash;hangs upon the thread of success.  Like
the South Sea Bubble, or any of those other
impostures of the financial sort, which have temporarily
beguiled the confidence of mankind, it must collapse
utterly under the shock of failure.  It depends
entirely on credit, and its powers of recuperation are
nil.  When its assets are disclosed, the characters of
its promoters will be understood.  The need, therefore,
is to bring it at all costs to a complete demonstration
of failure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
</p>

<p>
We have been urged by our own anti-militarists
not to inflict suffering and humiliation on Germany.
But this is not a matter of the slightest importance
one way or the other.  It has but little to do with the
issue which it is our business to settle, if we have the
good fortune to come out victorious from the present
struggle.  To set up the suffering and humiliation of
Germany as the object of high policy would cover
the Allies with contempt; but to shrink from such
things, if they should happen to stand between the
Allies and the utter moral bankruptcy of the Prussian
System, would overwhelm them with a burden far
heavier and more shameful than contempt.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
</h3>

<p>
A German might fairly contend that British
criticism of his moral ideas and political system is
tainted throughout by ignorance and prejudice,
and that all our talk of autocracy, bureaucracy,
pedantocracy, military caste, and sham constitutionalism
is merely an attempt to avoid the real issue by
calling things, which we happen to dislike, by bad
names.  Political institutions, he might insist, must
be judged by their fruits.  If this test were applied,
Germany in his opinion would have nothing to fear
in any comparison.
</p>

<p>
"We Germans," writes a correspondent, the
Freiherr von Hexenkchen,[<a id="chap0206fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn1">1</a>] "are not inferior in
intelligence or education to any other race.  Had
this been so, we could never have reached, in so
short a period as four decades, the proud position
which we now occupy in science, invention,
manufacture, commerce, finance, and administration.[<a id="chap0206fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn2">2</a>]
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
Consequently, if we are well content to live under
the institutions we possess, this cannot be put down
either to our want of enterprise or to the dulness
of our understandings.
</p>

<p>
"Our people have already shown that they are
willing to fight and die for these very institutions
which you Englishmen affect to regard with so much
contempt.  Possibly your people are equally willing
to fight and die for theirs.  I do not deny this;
but it is not yet proved; it remains to be proved.
</p>

<p>
"I do not assert that your people are inferior to
mine in their readiness to fight and die when they
are actually faced with a great national danger.
But I do claim that mine are superior to yours in
the constancy of their devotion to duty.  For a
hundred years past&mdash;not only in periods of stress
and danger, which stirred the national imagination,
but equally in times of peace and prosperity, which
always tend to encourage the growth of comfort and
the love of ease&mdash;each succeeding generation has
been found willing to train itself in the use of arms,
so as to be prepared, if occasion should arise, to
defend the Fatherland.
</p>

<p>
"When the present war broke out was there a
firmer loyalty or a more patriotic response to the
call to arms among your people or among mine?
Will your people fight and suffer more gladly for
their 'democratic' ideals than mine will for their
Kaiser and Fatherland? ... Surely, upon your
own principles no comparison should be possible
between the warmth of your devotion and the
tepidity of ours.
</p>

<p>
"Is our system really so reactionary and mechanical
as you imagine?  In an age which has learned
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
as its special lesson the advantages, in ordinary
business affairs of life, of organisation, thoroughness,
long views, reticence, and combined effort, guided
by a strong central control, is it reaction, or is it
progress, to aim at applying the same principles to
the greatest, most complex, and infinitely most
important of all businesses&mdash;that of government
itself?  Can a nation hope to survive which refuses,
in the name of freedom, to submit to control in
these respects, if it should be faced by competition
with another, which has been wise enough to employ
quiet experts instead of loquacious amateurs&mdash;any
more than a cotton mill could escape bankruptcy
were it managed on a system of party
government?
</p>

<p>
"Our civil service, which you are pleased to
describe as a Bureaucracy, is distinguished among
all others existing at the present time, by the calibre
of its members, by its efficiency and honesty, by its
poverty, and not less by the honour in which it is
held notwithstanding its poverty.  You laugh at
our love for calling men, and also their wives, by
the titles of their various offices&mdash;Herr this and Frau
that, from the humblest inspector of drains to the
Imperial Chancellor himself!  And no doubt there
is a ludicrous side to this practice.  But it marks
at least one important thing&mdash;that membership
of our civil service is regarded as conferring honour.
So far, we have succeeded in maintaining public
officials of all grades in higher popular respect than
men who devote their lives to building up private
fortunes, and also to those others who delight
and excel in interminable debate.
</p>

<p>
"You are used to boast, and I daresay rightly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
of the personal honesty and pecuniary disinterestedness
of your politicians; and you assume as a matter
of course that your civil servants, with such high
standards and examples ever before their eyes, are
likewise incorruptible.  We invert this order.  With
us the honour of our civil servants is the chief thing;
we assume that our politicians must follow suit.
They are probably as upright as your own, thanks
partly to tradition, but also to the vigilance of their
superiors, the professionals, who carry on the actual
business of government.  With you the fame of
the showy amateur fills the mouths of the public.
We, on the contrary, exalt the expert, the man
who has been trained to the job he undertakes.  In
so doing we may be reactionaries and you may be
progressives; but the progress of Germany since
1870&mdash;a progress in which we are everywhere either
already in front of you, or else treading closely on
your heels&mdash;does not seem to furnish you with a
conclusive argument.
</p>

<p>
"As for what you call our Pedantocracy, meaning
thereby our professors and men of letters, it is true
that these exercise a great influence upon public
opinion.  We have always respected learning and
thought.  It is in the German nature so to do.  I
admit that our learned ones are rather too much
inclined to imagine, that because they are students
of theory, they are therefore qualified to engage in
practice.  They are apt to offer their advice and
service officiously, and occasionally in a ridiculous
manner.  But, if my recollection of the English
newspapers be correct, this is no more so with us
than with you.  There is apparently something
in the professorial nature which impels men of this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
calling to the drafting of manifestoes and the
signing of round-robins in times of excitement.
They may be officious and absurd, but they are not
wholly despicable, since they act thus quite as much
from earnestness as from vanity.  If our academicians
on such occasions mislead more people than
your own it is due to their virtues, to the greater
zeal and success with which they have won the
confidence of their former pupils.[<a id="chap0206fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE MILITARY CASTE
</span>
</p>

<p>
"You are fond of sneering at our Military Caste
and attribute to it the most malign influence upon
public affairs.  But there again, believe me, you
exaggerate.  Our officers are undoubtedly held in
great respect, even in some awe.  And the reason
is that they are known to be brave, and like those
you call the bureaucracy, to have preferred
comparative poverty in the public service to the pursuit
of riches.  To say that they have no influence upon
policy would of course be absurd.  It is inevitable
that in the present state of the world, soldiers will
always have great influence in certain departments
of public affairs.  This must be so in any country
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
which is not plunged in dreams.  For it is their
business to guarantee national security, and to keep
watch over the growth of military strength among
the neighbours and rivals of Germany.  If the
general staff foresees dangers, and can give reasonable
grounds for its anticipations, it is clear that the
military view must carry weight with the Kaiser
and his ministers.  And surely there can be no
question that this is right.
</p>

<p>
"The officers of the German Army are a caste,
if you like to put it that way.  But in every form
of government under the sun, unless conceivably
in some tiny oriental despotism, the predominance
of a certain caste, or the competition between
different castes, is absolutely essential to the working
of the machinery.
</p>

<p>
"It is not regrettable in our opinion if a caste,
which has considerable weight in public affairs, is
a manly one, contemptuous of wealth and sophistry,
ready always to risk its own life for the faith which
is in it.  The influence of a military caste may have
its drawbacks; but at any rate it has kept the
peace in Germany for not far short of half a
century&mdash;kept it successfully until, as some people have
thought, the professors acquired too large a share
of power.
</p>

<p>
"Is it so certain, moreover, that the lawyer
caste, the self-advertising caste, and the financial
caste are not all of them a great deal worse, even a
great deal more dangerous to peace?  Is a country
any more likely to be safe, happy, and prosperous
under the rgime of a talking caste&mdash;of windbags
resourcefully keeping their bellows full of air, and
wheedling the most numerous with transparent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
falsehoods&mdash;than where civil servants of tried
wisdom and experience are responsible for carrying
on affairs of state, aided at their high task by sober
military opinion?[<a id="chap0206fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
"As for our Kaiser, whom you regard as a crafty
and ambitious tyrant, he appears in our view as
the incarnation of patriotic duty, burdened though
not overwhelmed by care&mdash;a lover of peace, so long
as peace may be had with honour and safety; but
if this may not be, then a stern, though reluctant,
drawer of the sword.  It is true that the Kaiser's
government is in many important respects a purely
personal government.  His is the ultimate responsibility
for high policy.  He fulfils the function in
our system of that strong central power, without
which the most ingeniously constructed organisation
is but impotence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN SELF-KNOWLEDGE
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The German people are ahead of the English
and the Americans in self-knowledge; for they
realise that there are many things appertaining
to government, which cannot be discussed in the
newspapers, or on the platform, any more than the
policy and conduct of a great business can be made
known in advance to the staff, and to trade
competitors all over the world.  And so, believing the
Kaiser's government to be honest, capable, and
devoted to the public weal, the German people
trust it without reservation to decide when action
shall be taken in a variety of spheres.
</p>

<p>
"This system of ours which is founded in reason,
and in experience of modern conditions, and which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
is upheld by the unfaltering confidence of a great
people, you are wont to condemn as tyrannical and
reactionary.  But can democracy stand against
it?&mdash;Democracy infirm of purpose, jealous, grudging,
timid, changeable, unthorough, unready, without
foresight, obscure in its aims, blundering along in
an age of lucidity guided only by a faltering and
confused instinct!  Given anything like an equal
contest, is it conceivable that such an undisciplined
chaos can prevail against the Hohenzollern
Empire?
</p>

<p>
"Of late your newspapers have been busily
complaining of what they call 'German lies,'
'boastfulness,' and 'vulgar abuse.'  They have taunted
our government with not daring to trust the people.
Our Headquarters bulletins have been vigorously
taken to task by the Allies on these and other
grounds.
</p>

<p>
"But all nations will acclaim their victories louder
than they will trumpet their defeats.  This is in
human nature.  No official communiqu will ever
be a perfect mirror of truth.  It will never give the
whole picture, but only a part; and by giving only
a part it will often mislead.  Were we to believe
literally what the various governments have hitherto
given out as regards their respective advances, the
Germans by this time might perhaps have been at
Moscow in the East and somewhere about the
Azores in the West.  But by the same token the
Russians should have been on the Rhine and the
French and English Allies at Berlin.
</p>

<p>
"I read your newspapers, and I read our own.
I do not think our journalists, though they do their
best, can fairly claim to excel yours in the contest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
of boastfulness and vulgar abuse.  And as regards
the utterances of responsible public men in our
two countries, can you really contend that we
Germans are more open to the reproach of
vainglorious and undignified speech than the British?
Our Kaiser denies having used the words, so often
attributed to him in your press, about 'General
French's contemptible little army,' and in Germany
we believe his denial.  But even if he did in fact
utter this expression, is it not quite as seemly and
restrained as references to 'digging rats out of
a hole'&mdash;as applied to our gallant navy&mdash;or to that
later announcement from the same quarter which
was recently addressed to the Mayor of Scarborough
about 'baby-killers'?  Such expressions are
regrettable, no doubt, but not of the first importance.
They are a matter of temperament.  An ill-balanced,
or even a very highly-strung nature, will be betrayed
into blunders of this sort more readily than the
phlegmatic person, or one whose upbringing has
been in circles where self-control is the rule of
manners.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
TRUST IN THE PEOPLE
</span>
</p>

<p>
"But what puzzles us Germans perhaps more than
any of your other charges against us is, when you
say that our rulers do not trust the people as the
British Government does.
</p>

<p>
"You accuse our War Office of publishing accounts
of imaginary victories to revive our drooping
confidence, and of concealing actual disasters lest our
country should fall into a panic of despondency.
There was surely nothing imaginary about the fall
of Lige, Namur, Maubeuge, Laon, or La Fere.
The engagements before Metz, at Mons, Charleroi,
and Amiens, the battles of Lodz and Lyck, were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
not inconsiderable successes for German arms,
or at the very least for German generalship.
The victory of Tannenberg was among the greatest
in history, reckoning in numbers alone.  Our
government made no secret of the German
retirement&mdash;retreat if you prefer the term&mdash;from the
Marne to the Aisne, or of that other falling back
after the first attempt on Warsaw.  Naturally they
laid less emphasis on reverses than on conquests,
but what government has ever acted otherwise?
Certainly not the French, or the Russian, or your
own.  And what actual disasters have we concealed?
In what respect, as regards the conduct of this war,
have we, the German people, been trusted less than
yours?
</p>

<p>
"I am especially interested, I confess, as a student
of British politics, in this matter of 'trusting the
people.'  All your great writers have led me to
believe that here lies the essential difference between
your system and ours, and that the great superiority
of yours to ours is demonstrated in the confidence
which your statesmen never hesitate to place in
the wisdom, fortitude, and patriotism of the people.
Frankly, I do not understand it.  Trust must surely
have some esoteric meaning when applied to your
populace which foreigners are unable to apprehend.
I can discover no other sense in your phrase about
'trusting the people,' than that they are trusted
not to find out their politicians.  It certainly
cannot be believed that you trust your people to
hear the truth; for if so why has your government
practised so rigorous an economy of this virtue,
doling it out very much as we have lately been doing
with our wheat and potatoes?

from no one else; for all the world was on the broad

motive of your government could not have been
to hide it away from the Germans, or the Austrians,

material injury, mind you, and not merely a
sentimental one&mdash;unless they had known, only too
well, that publication of this or that piece of news
would have too painfully affected the nerves of your
people?  Concealment of checks, reverses, and
disasters which had not already become known
to the Austrians and ourselves might have served a
useful military purpose; but what purpose except
that of a sedative for British public opinion could
be served by the concealment of such matters when
we, your enemies, knew them already?  Have you

do not come under the direct influence of ministerial
inspiration and example?  If so, why then
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
have your rulers not screwed up their courage
to call for national service?  Why do they still
continue to depend for their recruits upon sensational
advertisements, newspaper puffs, oratorical
entreaties, and private influence of a singularly
irregular sort?
</p>

<p>
"Is not this the reason?&mdash;Your government is
afraid&mdash;even in this great struggle, where (as they
put it) your future existence as a nation is at
stake&mdash;that the English people&mdash;or at any rate so large a
proportion of them, as if rendered uncomfortable
could create a political disturbance&mdash;is not even yet
prepared to make the necessary sacrifices.  And
so, to the amazement of us Germans, you let the
older men, with families dependent on them, go
forth to the war, urged on by a high sense of duty,
while hundreds of thousands of young unmarried
men are still allowed to stay at home.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
COMPARISON OF RECRUITING
</span>
</p>

<p>
"You are still, it would appear, enamoured of
your voluntary system.  You have not yet abandoned
your belief that it is the duty of the man, who
possesses a sense of duty, to protect the skin, family,
and property of the man who does not.  To us
this seems a topsy-turvy creed, and not more
topsy-turvy than contemptible.  In Germany and
France&mdash;where for generations past the doctrine of
private sacrifice for the public weal is ingrained,
and has been approved in principle and applied in
practice with unfaltering devotion&mdash;a 'voluntary'
system might conceivably have some chance of
providing such an army as you are in search of.  But
to the United Kingdom surely it is singularly
inapplicable?  Let me illustrate my meaning by a
comparison.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Our Kaiser in his New Year's message&mdash;which
in Germany we all read with enthusiasm, and
considered very noble and appropriate&mdash;summed up the
military situation by saying that after five months'
hard and hot fighting the war was still being
waged almost everywhere off German soil, and on
the enemies' territories.  And he summed up the
domestic situation by saying (and this, believe me,
is true) that our nation stands in unexampled
harmony, prepared to sacrifice its heart's blood for
the defence of the Fatherland.  Another three
months have passed away, and these statements
still hold good.
</p>

<p>
"The point to which I chiefly wish to call your
attention is one of numbers, and I will take my
estimates of numbers from your own most famous
newspaper experts.
</p>

<p>
"Your claim, as I understand it, is that on New
Year's Day 1915 you had&mdash;exclusive of Indian troops
and Dominion contingents&mdash;between 2,000,000 and
2,500,000 men training and in the field.
</p>

<p>
"Germany alone (here again I quote your English
experts), without reckoning Austria, has actually
put into the field during the past five months
5,000,000 men.  Of these it is stated by your
newspapers that she has lost in round figures 1,500,000,
who have either been killed, or taken prisoners,
or are too severely wounded to return as yet to
the fighting line.  But in spite of this depletion,
your military statisticians tell us that Germany
and her ally, at New Year's Day, still outnumbered
the Allies on both the Eastern and the Western
frontier.
</p>

<p>
"The same high authorities tell us further, that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
during this period of five months, the German
Government has called upon the civil population,
has appealed to able-bodied men who had previously
been exempt from military service, and that by
this means it has obtained, and has been engaged in
training, arming, and equipping another 4,000,000
or 4,500,000 who, it is anticipated, will become
available for war purposes in new formations, during
the spring and summer of the present year.
</p>

<p>
"Our Government, therefore, according to your
own account, has not been afraid to ask the civil
population to serve, and this is the response.  Does
it look as if the national spirit had been quenched
under our autocratic system?
</p>

<p>
"Out of our whole population of sixty-five millions
we have apparently raised for military service on
land and naval service at sea, between 9,000,000 and
11,000,000 men since this war began.  Out of your
whole population of forty-five millions you have
succeeded in raising for these same purposes only
something between 2,000,000 and 2,500,000 men.
And in your case, be it observed, in order to attract
recruits, you have offered good wages and munificent
separation allowances; while in our case men serve
without pay.
</p>

<p>
"This numerical comparison is worth carrying a
stage further.  Germany and her ally have between
them a total population of 115,000,000.  The United
Kingdom (including the people of European stock
who inhabit the various Dominions), France, Russia,
Belgium, Servia, and Montenegro number in round
figures about 280,000,000.  Roughly speaking, these
are odds of seven to three against us.  And I am
leaving out of account all the non-European races&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
Turks on the one side, the Japanese and the
Indians on the other.  If these were included the
odds would be much heavier.
</p>

<p>
"And yet our Kaiser spoke but the simple
truth, when he told us on New Year's Day that,
after five months of war, the German armies were
almost everywhere on the territories of their enemies.
We are not only keeping you back and defying
all your efforts to invade us; but like the infant
Hercules, we have gripped you by your throats, and
were holding you out at arm's length!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
METHODS OF RECRUITING
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I do not of course pretend to look at this matter
except from the German standpoint; but is there
any flaw in my reasoning, is there anything at all
unfair, if I thus sum up my conclusions?&mdash;By
Midsummer next&mdash;after stupendous efforts of the
oratorical and journalistic kind&mdash;after an enormous
amount of shouting, music-hall singing, cinema films,
and showy advertising of every description&mdash;after
making great play with the name and features of a
popular field-marshal, in a manner which must have
shocked both his natural modesty and soldierly
pride&mdash;after all this you expect, or say you expect,
that you will possess between two and two-and-a-half
millions of men trained, armed, equipped, and ready
to take the field.
</p>

<p>
"As against this, during the same period, and
out of the less military half of our male population,
without any shouting or advertising to speak of,
we shall have provided approximately double that
number.  We have raised these new forces quietly,
without any fuss, and without a word of protest
from any of our people.  We are training them
without any serious difficulty.  We are arming
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
them, equipping them, clothing them, and housing
them without any difficulty at all.
</p>

<p>
"To conclude this interesting contrast, may I
ask you&mdash;is it true, as the French newspapers allege,
that you are about to invite, or have already invited,
your Japanese Allies to send some portion of their
Army to European battlefields?  With what face
can you make this appeal when you have not yet
called upon your own people to do, what every other
people engaged in the present struggle, has already
done?
</p>

<p>
"After you have pondered upon this strange and
startling contrast, will you still hold to the opinion
that the German system&mdash;which you have affected
to despise, on the ground that it does not rest upon
what you are pleased to term 'a popular basis'&mdash;is
at any point inferior to your own in its hold upon
the hearts of the people?
</p>

<p>
"What is meant by the phrase&mdash;'a popular
basis'?  Is it something different from the support
of the people, the will of the people, the devotion
of the people?  And if it is different, is it
better&mdash;judging, that is, by its results in times of
trouble&mdash;or is it worse?"
</p>

<p>
So the cultured Freiherr, watching democracy at
work in Britain, its ancient home, concludes with
this question&mdash;"Is this timid, jealous, and distracted
thing possessed of any real faith in itself; and if so,
will it fight for its faith to the bitter end?  Is the
British system one which even the utmost faith in it
can succeed in propping up?  Does it possess any
inherent strength; or is it merely a thing of
paste-board and make-believe, fore-ordained to perish?"

<a id="chap0206fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap0206fn3text">3</a>] It is not quite clear to what incidents
the Freiherr is referring.  He
may be thinking of a certain round-robin
which appeared a few days before
the war, giving a most handsome academic
testimonial of humanity and
probity to the German system; or he may have
in mind a later manifestation
in February last, when there suddenly
flighted into the correspondence
columns of the <i>Nation</i> a 'gaggle'
of university geese, headed appropriately
enough by a Professor of Political Economy,
by name Pigou, who may be
taken as the type of that peculiarly
British product, the unemotional
sentimentalist.  To this 'gaggle'
of the heavier fowls there succeeded in
due course a 'glory' of poetical and
literary finches, twittering the same
tune&mdash;the obligation on the Allies not
to inflict suffering and humiliation on
Germany&mdash;on Germany, be it remembered,
as yet unbeaten, though this
was rather slurred over in their spring-song
of lovingkindness.  The Freiherr,
plunged in his heathen darkness,
no doubt still believed Germany to be not
only unbeaten but victorious,
and likely to continue on the same course.
He must therefore have been somewhat
puzzled by so much tender concern
on the part of our professors, etc. for
sparing his feelings at the end of the
war.

a speech by Sir Stanley Buckmaster,
the Solicitor-General and Chairman of
the Press Bureau on November 12, 1914.
It is distressing to see how far
national prejudice is apt to mislead
a hostile critic like the Freiherr von
Hexenkchen: "Criticism of the Government,
or of members of the
Government, is not that which I have
ever stopped, except when such
criticism is of such a character that
it might destroy public confidence
in the Government, which at this moment
is charged with the conduct of
the war, or might in any way weaken the
confidence of the people in the
administration of affairs, or otherwise
cause distress or disturbance amongst
people in thinking their affairs were
in a really serious state."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
THE CONFLICT OF SYSTEMS AND IDEAS
</h3>

<p>
The Freiherr's discourse raises a large number of
questions, some of them unarguable.  Others again
are too much so; for if once started upon, argument
with regard to them need never end.  Some of his
contentions have already been dealt with in previous
chapters; some on the other hand, such as the
British methods of recruiting, will be considered
later on.  It must, however, be admitted that his
taunts and criticisms do not all rebound with blunted
points from our shield of self-complacency; some, if
only a few, get home and rankle.
</p>

<p>
We are challenged to contrast our faith in our
own political institutions with that of the Germans
in theirs; also to measure the intrinsic strength of
that form of political organisation called 'democracy'
against that other form which is known as 'autocracy.'
</p>

<p>
The German state is the most highly developed
and efficient type of personal monarchy at present
known to the world.  Its triumphs in certain
directions have been apparent from the beginning.
It would be sheer waste of time to dispute the fact
that Germany was incomparably better prepared,
organised, and educated for this war&mdash;the purpose
of which was the spoliation of her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
neighbours&mdash;than any of her neighbours were for offering
resistance.
</p>

<p>
But what the Freiherr does not touch upon at all
is the conflict between certain underlying ideas of
right and wrong&mdash;old ideas, which are held by Russia,
France, and ourselves, and which now find themselves
confronted by new and strange ideas which have been
exceedingly prevalent among the governing classes
in Germany for many years past.  He does not
raise <i>this</i> issue, any more than his fellow-countrymen
now raise it either in America or at home.  It is
true that there was a flamboyant outburst from a
few faithful Treitschkians and Nietzschians, both in
prose and poetry, during those weeks of August and
September which teemed with German successes;
but their voices soon sank below audibility&mdash;possibly
by order <i>verboten</i>&mdash;in a swiftly dying fall.  We,
however, cannot agree to let this aspect of the matter
drop, merely because patriotic Germans happen to
have concluded that the present time is inopportune
for the discussion of it.
</p>

<p>
There are two clear and separate issues.  From
the point of view of posterity the more important
of these, perhaps, may prove to be this conflict in
the region of moral ideas.  From the point of view
of the present generation, however, the chief matter
of practical interest is the result of a struggle for the
preservation of our own institutions, against the
aggression of a race which has not yet learned the
last and hardest lesson of civilisation&mdash;how to live
and let live.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DEMOCRACY
</span>
</p>

<p>
The present war may result in the bankruptcy
of the Habsburg and Hohenzollern dynasties.  It
is very desirable, however, to make clear the fact
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
that the alternative is the bankruptcy of
'democracy.'  Our institutions are now being subjected to
a severer strain than they have ever yet experienced.
Popular government is standing its trial.  It will be
judged by the result; and no one can say that this is
an unfair test to apply to human institutions.
</p>

<p>
No nation, unless it be utterly mad, will retain
a form of government which from some inherent
defect is unable to protect itself against external
attack.  Is democratic government capable of looking
ahead, making adequate and timely preparation,
calling for and obtaining from its people the sacrifices
which are necessary in order to preserve their own
existence?  Can it recover ground which has been lost,
and maintain a long, costly, and arduous struggle,
until, by victory, it has placed national security
beyond the reach of danger?
</p>

<p>
Defeat in the present war would shake popular
institutions to their foundations in England as well
as France; possibly also in regions which are more
remote than either of these.  But something far short
of defeat&mdash;anything indeed in the nature of a drawn
game or stalemate&mdash;would assuredly bring the credit
of democracy so low that it would be driven to make
some composition with its creditors.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Words, like other currencies, have a way of
changing their values as the world grows older.
Until comparatively recent times 'democracy' was
a term of contempt, as 'demagogue' still is to-day.
</p>

<p>
The founders of American Union abhorred 'Democracy,'[<a id="chap0207fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0207fn1">1</a>]
and took every precaution which occurred
to them in order to ward it off.  Their aim was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
'Popular,' or 'Representative Government'&mdash;a thing
which they conceived to lie almost at the opposite
pole.  Their ideal was a state, the citizens of which
chose their leaders at stated intervals, and trusted
them.  Democracy, as it appeared in their eyes, was a
political chaos where the people chose its servants,
and expected from them only servility.  There was
an ever-present danger, calling for stringent
safeguards, that the first, which they esteemed the best
of all constitutional arrangements, would degenerate
into the second, which they judged to be the worst.
</p>

<p>
Until times not so very remote it was only the
enemies of Representative Government, or its most
cringing flatterers, who spoke of it by the title of
Democracy.  Gradually, however, in the looseness of
popular discussions, the sharpness of the original
distinction wore off, so that the ideal system and its
opposite&mdash;the good and the evil&mdash;are now confounded
together under one name.  There is no use fighting
against current terminology; but it is well to bear
in mind that terminology has no power to alter facts,
and that the difference between the two principles
still remains as wide as it was at the beginning.
</p>

<p>
When a people becomes so self-complacent that
it mistakes its own ignorance for omniscience&mdash;so
jealous of authority and impatient of contradiction
that it refuses to invest with more than a mere shadow
of power those whose business it is to govern&mdash;when
the stock of leadership gives out, or remains hidden
and undiscovered under a litter of showy refuse&mdash;when
those who succeed in pushing themselves to the
front are chiefly concerned not to lead, but merely
to act the parts of leaders 'in silver slippers and
amid applause'&mdash;when the chiefs of parties are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
so fearful of unpopularity that they will not assert
their own opinions, or utter timely warnings, or
proclaim what they know to be the truth&mdash;when such
things as these come to pass the nation has reached
that state which was dreaded by the framers of
the American Constitution, and which&mdash;intending
to warn mankind against it&mdash;they branded as
'Democracy.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DANGERS OF SELF-CRITICISM
</span>
</p>

<p>
Self-criticism makes for health in a people; but
it may be overdone.  If it purges the national spirit
it is good; but if it should lead to pessimism, or to
some impatient breach with tradition, it is one of
the worst evils.  One is conscious of a somewhat
dangerous tendency in certain quarters at the present
time to assume the worst with regard to the working
of our own institutions.
</p>

<p>
Critics of this school have pointed out (what is
undoubtedly true) that Germany has been far ahead
of us in her preparations.  Every month since war
began has furnished fresh evidence of the far-sightedness,
resourcefulness, thoroughness, and efficiency of
all her military arrangements.  Her commercial and
financial resources have also been husbanded, and
organised in a manner which excites our unwilling
admiration.  And what perhaps has been the rudest
shock of all, is the apparent unity and devotion of
the whole German people, in support of a war which,
without exaggeration, may be said to have cast the
shadow of death on every German home.
</p>

<p>
These critics further insist that our own nation has
not shown itself more loyal, and that it did not rouse
itself to the emergency with anything approaching
the same swiftness.  Timidity and a wilful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
self-deception, they say, have marked our policy for
years before this war broke out.  They marked it
again when the crisis came upon us.  Have they not
marked it ever since war began?  And who can
have confidence that they will not continue to mark
it until the end, whatever the end may be?
</p>

<p>
The conclusion therefore at which our more despondent
spirits have arrived, is that the representative
system has already failed us&mdash;that it has suffered
that very degradation which liberal minds of the
eighteenth century feared so much.  How can
democracy in the bad sense&mdash;democracy which has become
decadent&mdash;which is concerned mainly with its rights
instead of with its duties&mdash;with its comforts more than
with the sacrifices which are essential to its own
preservation&mdash;how can such a system make head against
an efficient monarchy sustained by the enthusiastic
devotion of a vigorous and intelligent people?
</p>

<p>
It does not seem altogether wise to despair of
one's own institutions at the first check.  Even
democracy, in the best sense, is not a flawless thing.
Of all forms of government it is the most delicate,
more dependent than any other upon the supply of
leaders.  There are times of dearth when the crop
of leadership is a short one.  Nor are popular
institutions, any more than our own vile bodies,
exempt from disease.  Disease, however, is not
necessarily fatal.  The patient may recover, and in the
bracing air of a national crisis, such as the present,
conditions are favourable for a cure.
</p>

<p>
And, after all, we may remind these critics that
in 1792 democracy did in fact make head pretty
successfully against monarchy.  Though it was miserably
unprovided, untrained, inferior to its enemies in everything
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
save spirit and leadership, the states of Europe
nevertheless&mdash;all but England&mdash;went down before it,
in the years which followed, like a row of ninepins.
Then as now, England, guarded by seas and sea-power,
had a breathing-space allowed her, in which to
adjust the spirit of her people to the new conditions.
That Germany will not conquer us with her arms
we may well feel confident.  But unless we conquer
her with <i>our arms</i>&mdash;and this is a much longer
step&mdash;there is a considerable danger that she may yet
conquer us with <i>her ideas</i>.  In that case the world
will be thrown back several hundred years; and the
blame for this disaster, should it occur, will be
laid&mdash;and laid rightly&mdash;at the door of Democracy, because
it vaunted a system which it had neither the fortitude
nor the strength to uphold.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
IRRECONCILABLE OPPOSITIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
When we pass from the conflict between systems
of government, and come to the other conflict of
ideas as to right and wrong, we find ourselves faced
with an antagonism which is wholly incapable of
accommodation.  In this war the stakes are
something more than any of the material interests
involved.  It is a conflict where one faith is pitted
against another.  No casuistry will reconcile the ideal
which inspires English policy with the ideal which
inspires German policy.  There is no sense&mdash;nothing
indeed but danger&mdash;in arguing round the circle to
prove that the rulers of these two nations are victims
of some frightful misunderstanding, and that really at
the bottom of their hearts they believe the same
things.  This is entirely untrue: they believe quite
different things; things indeed which are as nearly
as possible opposites.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
</p>

<p>
Our own belief is old, ingrained, and universal.
It is accepted equally by the people and their rulers.
We have held it so long that the articles of our creed
have become somewhat blurred in outline&mdash;overgrown,
like a memorial tablet, by moss and lichen.
</p>

<p>
In the case of our enemy the tablet is new and the
inscription sharp.  He who runs may read it in bold
clear-cut lettering.  But the belief of the German
people in the doctrine which has been carved upon
the stone is not yet universal, or anything like
universal.  It is not even general.  It is fully
understood and accepted only in certain strata of society;
but it is responsible, without a doubt, for the making
in cold blood of the policy which has led to this war.
When the hour struck which the German rulers
deemed favourable for conquest, war, according to
their creed, became the duty as well as the interest
of the Fatherland.
</p>

<p>
But so soon as war had been declared, the German
people were allowed and even encouraged to believe
that the making of war from motives of self-interest
was a crime against humanity&mdash;the Sin against the
Holy Ghost.  They were allowed and encouraged
to believe that the Allies were guilty of this crime and
sin.  And not only this, but war itself, which had
been hymned in so many professorial rhapsodies,
as a noble and splendid restorer of vigour and virtue,
was now execrated with wailing and gnashing of
teeth, as the most hideous of all human calamities.
</p>

<p>
It is clear from all this that the greater part of
the German people regarded war in exactly the same
light as the whole of the English people did.  In
itself it was a curse; and the man who deliberately
contrived it for his own ends, or even for those of his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
country, was a criminal.  The German people applied
the same tests as we did, and it is not possible to doubt
that in so doing they were perfectly sincere.  They
acted upon instinct.  They had not learned the later
doctrines of the pedantocracy, or how to steer by
a new magnetic pole.  They still held by the old
Christian rules as to duties which exist between
neighbours.  To their simple old-fashioned loyalty what
their Kaiser said must be the truth.  And what their
Kaiser said was that the Fatherland was attacked
by treacherous foes.  That was enough to banish
all doubts.  For the common people that was the
reality and the only reality.  Phrases about
world-power and will-to-power&mdash;supposing they had ever
heard or noticed them&mdash;were only mouthfuls of
strange words, such as preachers of all kinds love to
chew in the intervals of their discourses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
APOSTASY OF THE PRIESTHOOD
</span>
</p>

<p>
When the priests and prophets found themselves
at last confronted by those very horrors which they
had so often invoked, did their new-found faith
desert them, or was it only that their tongues, for
some reason, refused to speak the old jargon?
Judging by their high-flown indignation against the
Allies it would rather seem as if, in the day of wrath,
they had hastily abandoned sophistication for the
pious memories of their unlettered childhood.  Their
apostasy was too well done to have been hypocrisy.
</p>

<p>
With the rulers it was different.  They knew
clearly enough what they had done, what they were
doing, and what they meant to do.  When they
remained sympathetically silent, amid the popular
babble about the horrors of war and iniquity of
peace-breakers, their tongues were not paralysed by
remorse&mdash;they were merely in their cheeks.  Their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
sole concern was to humour public opinion, the
results of whose disapproval they feared, quite as
much as they despised its judgment.
</p>

<p>
That war draws out and gives scope to some of
the noblest human qualities, which in peace-time are
apt to be hidden out of sight, no one will deny.  That
it is a great getter-rid of words and phrases, which
have no real meaning behind them&mdash;that it is a great
winnower of true men from shams, of staunch men
from boasters and blowers of their own trumpets&mdash;that
it is a great binder-together of classes, a great
purifier of the hearts of nations, there is no need
to dispute.  Occasionally, though very rarely, it
has proved itself to be a great destroyer of
misunderstanding between the combatants themselves.
</p>

<p>
But although the whole of this is true, it does
not lighten the guilt of the deliberate peace-breaker.
Many of the same benefits, though in a lesser degree,
arise out of a pestilence, a famine, or any other great
national calamity; and it is the acknowledged duty
of man to strive to the uttermost against these and
to ward them off with all his strength.  It is the same
with war.  To argue, as German intellectuals have
done of late, that in order to expand their territories
they were justified in scattering infection and deliberately
inviting this plague, that the plague itself was
a thing greatly for the advantage of the moral sanitation
of the world&mdash;all this is merely the casuistry of
a priesthood whom the vanity of rubbing elbows
with men of action has beguiled of their salvation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE ARROGANCE OF PEDANTS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in one of his essays Emerson introduces
an interlocutor whom he salutes as 'little Sir.'  One
feels tempted to personify the whole corporation of
German pedants under the same title.  When they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
talk so vehemently and pompously about the duty
of deliberate war-making for the expansion of the
Fatherland, for the fulfilment of the theory of
evolution, even for the glory of God on high, our minds
are filled with wonder and a kind of pity.
</p>

<p>
Have they ever seen war except in their dreams,
or a countryside in devastation?  Have they ever
looked with their own eyes on shattered limbs, or
faces defaced, of which cases, and the like, there are
already some hundreds of thousands in the hospitals
of Europe, and may be some millions before this war
is ended?  Have they ever reckoned&mdash;except in
columns of numerals without human meaning&mdash;how
many more hundreds of thousands, in the flower of
their age, have died and will die, or&mdash;more to be
pitied&mdash;will linger on maimed and impotent when the war
is ended?  Have they realised any of these things,
except in diagrams, and curves, and statistical tables,
dealing with the matter&mdash;as they would say
themselves, in their own dull and dry fashion&mdash;'under
its broader aspects'&mdash;in terms, that is, of population,
food-supply, and economic output?
</p>

<p>
Death, and suffering of many sorts occur in all
wars&mdash;even in the most humane war.  And this is
not a humane war which the pedants have let loose
upon us.  Indeed, they have taught with some
emphasis that humanity, under such conditions, is
altogether a mistake.
</p>

<p>
"Sentimentality!" cries the 'little Sir'
impatiently, "sickly sentimentality!  In a world of
men such things must be.  God has ordained war."
</p>

<p>
Possibly.  But what one feels is that the making
of war is the Lord's own business and not the 'little
Sir's.'  It is the Lord's, as vengeance is, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
earthquakes, floods, and droughts; not an office to be
undertaken by mortals.
</p>

<p>
The 'little Sir,' however, has devised a new order
for the world, and apparently he will never rest
satisfied until Heaven itself conforms to his initiative.
He is audacious, for like the Titans he has challenged
Zeus.  But at times we are inclined to wonder&mdash;is he
not perhaps trying too much?  Is he not in fact
engaged in an attempt to outflank Providence, whose
pivot is infinity?  And for this he is relying solely
upon the resources of his own active little finite mind.
He presses his attack most gallantly against human
nature&mdash;back and forwards, up and down&mdash;but
opposing all his efforts is there not a screen of
adamantine crystal which cannot be pierced, of
interminable superficies which cannot be
circumvented?  Is he not in some ways like a wasp, which
beats itself angrily against a pane of glass?

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
A REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(<i>January</i> 1901-<i>July</i> 1914)
</p>

<p>
It is not true to say that this is a war between
the rival principles of democracy and autocracy.  A
too great absorption in our own particular sector of
the situation has led certain writers to put forward,
as a general explanation, this formula which is not
only inadequate, but misleading.  The real issue is
something wider and deeper than a struggle between
forms of government.  It is concerned with the
groundwork of human beliefs.
</p>

<p>
And yet it is unquestionably true to say, that by
reason of Germany's procedure, this war is being
waged against democracy&mdash;not perhaps by intention,
but certainly in effect.  For if the Allies should be
defeated, or even if they should fail to conquer their
present enemies, the result must necessarily be
wounding to the credit of popular institutions all
the world over, fatal to their existence in Europe at
any rate, fatal conceivably at no long distance of
time to their existence elsewhere than in Europe.
For mankind, we may be sure, is not going to put
up with any kind of government merely because it
is ideally beautiful.  No system will be tolerated
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
indefinitely which does not enable the people who live
under it to protect themselves from their enemies.
The instinct of self-preservation will drive them to
seek for some other political arrangement which is
competent, in the present imperfect condition of the
world, to provide the first essential of a state, which
is Security.
</p>

<p>
But although the whole fabric of democracy is
threatened by this war, the principle of autocracy is
not challenged by it either directly or indirectly.
France and England are not fighting against personal
monarchy any more than Russia is fighting against
popular government.  So far as the forms of
constitutions are concerned each of the Allies would be
well content to live and let live.  They are none of
them spurred on by propagandist illusions like the
armies of the First Republic.  Among Russians,
devotion to their own institutions, and attachment
to the person of their Emperor are inspired not merely
by dictates of political expediency and patriotism,
but also by their sense of religious duty.[<a id="chap0301fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn1">1</a>]  It is
inconceivable that the national spirit of Russia could
ever have been roused to universal enthusiasm merely
in order to fight the battles of democracy.  And yet
Russia is now ranged side by side with the French
Republic and the British Commonwealth in perfect
unison.  What has induced her to submit to
sacrifices&mdash;less indeed than those of Belgium, but equal to
those of France, and much greater so far than our
own&mdash;unless some issue was at stake wider and deeper
even than the future of popular government?
</p>

<p>
The instincts of a people are vague and obscure.
The reasons which are put forward, the motives
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
which appear upon the surface, the provocations
which lead to action, the immediate ends which are
sought after and pursued, rarely explain the true
causes or proportions of any great national struggle.
But for all that, the main issue, as a rule, is realised
by the masses who are engaged, although it is not
realised through the medium of coherent argument
or articulate speech.
</p>

<p>
The present war is a fight, not between democracy
and autocracy, but between the modern spirit of
Germany and the unchanging spirit of civilisation.
And it is well to bear in mind that the second of these
is not invincible.  It has suffered defeat before now,
at various epochs in the world's history, when attacked
by the same forces which assail it to-day.  Barbarism
is not any the less barbarism because it employs
weapons of precision, because it avails itself of the
discoveries of science and the mechanism of finance,
or because it thinks it worth while to hire bands of
learned men to shriek pans in its praise and
invectives against its victims.  Barbarism is not
any the less barbarism because its methods are
up to date.  It is known for what it is by the ends
which it pursues and the spirit in which it pursues
them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN MATERIALISM
</span>
</p>

<p>
The modern spirit of Germany is materialism in
its crudest form&mdash;the undistracted pursuit of wealth,
and of power as a means to wealth.  It is materialism,
rampant and self-confident, fostered by the
state&mdash;subsidised, regulated, and, where thought
advisable, controlled by the state&mdash;supported everywhere
by the diplomatic resources of the state&mdash;backed
in the last resort by the fleets and armies of
the state.  It is the most highly organised machine,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
the most deliberate and thorough-going system, for
arriving at material ends which has ever yet been
devised by man.  It is far more efficient, but not a
whit less material, than 'Manchesterism' of the
Victorian era, which placed its hopes in 'free'
competition, and also than that later development of
trusts and syndicates&mdash;hailing from America&mdash;which
aims at levying tribute on society by means of
'voluntary' co-operation.  And just as the English
professors, who fell prostrate in adoration before the
prosperity of cotton-spinners, found no difficulty in
placing self-interest upon the loftiest pedestal of
morality, so German professors have succeeded in
erecting for the joint worship of the Golden Calf and
the War-god Wotun, high twin altars which look
down with pity and contempt upon the humbler
shrines of the Christian faith.
</p>

<p>
The morality made in Manchester has long ago
lost its reputation.  That which has been made in
Germany more recently must in the end follow suit;
for, like its predecessor, it is founded upon a false
conception of human nature and cannot endure.
But in the interval, if it be allowed to triumph, it
may work evil, in comparison with which that done
by our own devil-take-the-hindmost philosophers
sinks into insignificance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
WANT OF A NATIONAL POLICY
</span>
</p>

<p>
Looking at the present war from the standpoint
of the Allies, the object of it is to repel the
encroachments of materialism, working its way through the
ruin of ideas, which have been cherished always, save
in the dark ages when civilisation was overwhelmed
by barbarism.  Looking at the matter from our own
particular standpoint, it is also incidentally a struggle
for the existence of democracy.  The chief question
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
we have to ask ourselves is whether our people will
fight for their faith and traditions with the same
skill and courage as the Germans for their material
ends?  Will they endure sacrifices with the same
fortitude as France and Russia?  Will they face the
inevitable eagerly and promptly, or will they play
the laggard and by delay ruin all&mdash;themselves most
of all? ... This war is not going to be won for us
by other people, or by some miraculous intervention
of Providence, or by the Germans running short of
copper, or by revolutions in Berlin, nor even by the
break-up of the Austrian Empire.  In order to win it
we shall have to put out our full strength, to organise
our resources in men and material as we have never
done before during the whole of our history.  We
have not accomplished these things as yet, although
we have expressed our determination, and are indeed
willing to attempt them.  We were taken by surprise,
and the immediate result has been a great confusion,
very hard to disentangle.
</p>

<p>
Considering how little, before war began, our
people had been taken into the confidence of
successive governments, as to the relations of the British
Empire with the outside world; how little education
of opinion there had been, as to risks, and dangers,
and means of defence; how little leading and clear
guidance, both before and since, as to duties&mdash;considering
all these omissions one can only marvel that
the popular response has been what it is, and that
the confusion was not many times worse.
</p>

<p>
What was the mood of the British race when this
war broke upon them so unexpectedly?  To what
extent were they provided against it in a material
sense?  And still more important, how far were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
their minds and hearts prepared to encounter it?
It is important to understand those things, but in
order to do this it is necessary to look back over a
few years.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By a coincidence which may prove convenient to
historians, the end of the nineteenth century marked
the beginning of a new epoch[<a id="chap0301fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn2">2</a>]&mdash;an interlude, of brief
duration as it proved&mdash;upon which the curtain was
rung down shortly before midnight on the 4th of
August 1914.
</p>

<p>
Between these two dates, in a space of something
over thirteen years, events had happened in a quick
succession, both within the empire and abroad,
which disturbed or dissolved many ancient
understandings.  The spirit of change had been busy with
mankind, and needs unknown to a former generation
had grown clamorous.  Objects of hope had presented
themselves, driving old ideas to the wall, and
unforeseen dangers had produced fresh groupings,
compacts, and associations between states, and
parties, and individual men.
</p>

<p>
In Europe during this period the manifest
determination of Germany to challenge the naval
supremacy of Britain, by the creation of a fleet
designed and projected as the counterpart of her
overwhelming army, had threatened the security of
the whole continent, and had put France, Russia, and
England upon terms not far removed from those of an
alliance.  The gravity of this emergency had induced
our politicians to exclude, for the time being, this
department of public affairs from the bitterness
of their party struggles; and it had also drawn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
the governments of the United Kingdom and the
Dominions into relations closer than ever before, for
the purpose of mutual defence.[<a id="chap0301fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EAST
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile there had been developments
even more startling in the hitherto unchanging East.
Japan, as the result of a great war,[<a id="chap0301fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn4">4</a>] had become a
first-class power, redoubtable both by sea and land.
China, the most populous, the most ancient, and the
most conservative of despotisms, had suddenly sought
her salvation under the milder institutions of a
republic.[<a id="chap0301fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
The South African war, ended by the Peace of
Pretoria, had paved the way for South African Union.[<a id="chap0301fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn6">6</a>]
The achievement of this endeavour had been applauded
by men of all parties; some finding in it a
welcome confirmation of their theories with regard
to liberty and self-government; others again drawing
from it encouragement to a still bolder undertaking.
For if South Africa had made a precedent, the existing
state of the world had supplied a motive, for the
closer union of the empire.
</p>

<p>
Within the narrower limits of the United Kingdom
changes had also occurred within this period which,
from another point of view, were equally momentous.
In 1903 Mr. Chamberlain had poured new wine into
old bottles, and in so doing had hastened the
inevitable end of Unionist predominance by changing
on a sudden the direction of party policy.  In the
unparalleled defeat which ensued two and a half
years later the Labour party appeared for the first
time, formidable both in numbers and ideas.
</p>

<p>
A revolution had likewise been proceeding in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
our institutions as well as in the minds of our people.
The balance of the state had been shifted by a
curtailment of the powers of the House of Lords[<a id="chap0301fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn7">7</a>]&mdash;the
first change which had been made by statute in the
fundamental principle of the Constitution since the
passing of the Act of Settlement.[<a id="chap0301fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn8">8</a>]  In July 1914
further changes of a similar character, hardly less
important under a practical aspect, were upon the
point of receiving the Royal Assent.[<a id="chap0301fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
Both these sets of changes&mdash;that which had been
already accomplished and the other which was about
to pass into law&mdash;had this in common, that even
upon the admissions of their own authors they were
incomplete.  Neither in the Parliament Act nor in
the Home Rule Act was there finality.  The
composition of the Second Chamber had been set down
for early consideration, whilst a revision of the
constitutional relations between England, Scotland,
and Wales was promised so soon as the case of Ireland
had been dealt with.
</p>

<p>
It seemed as if the modern spirit had at last, in
earnest, opened an inquisition upon the adequacy of
our ancient unwritten compact, which upon the
whole, had served its purpose well for upwards of
two hundred years.  It seemed as if that compact
were in the near future to be tested thoroughly, and
examined in respect of its fitness for dealing with the
needs of the time&mdash;with the complexities and the
vastness of the British Empire&mdash;with the evils which
prey upon us from within, and with the dangers which
threaten us from without.
</p>

<p>
Questioners were not drawn from one party alone.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
They were pressing forwards from all sides.  It was
not merely the case of Ireland, or the powers of the
Second Chamber, or its composition, or the general
congestion of business, or the efficiency of the House
of Commons: it was the whole machinery of government
which seemed to need overhauling and reconsideration
in the light of new conditions.  Most
important of all these constitutional issues was that
which concerned the closer union of the Empire.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was little more than eighty years since the Iron
Duke had described the British Constitution as an
incomparably devised perfection which none but a
madman would seek to change.  That was not now the
creed of any political party or indeed of any thinking
man.  No one was satisfied with things as they were.
Many of the most respectable old phrases had become
known for empty husks, out of which long since
had dropped whatever seed they may originally
have contained.  Many of the old traditions were
dead or sickly, and their former adherents were
now wandering at large, like soldiers in the middle
ages, when armies were disbanded in foreign parts,
seeking a new allegiance, and constituting in the
meanwhile a danger to security and the public
peace.
</p>

<p>
And also, within this brief period, the highest
offices had become vacant, and many great figures
had passed from the scene.  Two sovereigns had
died full of honour.  Two Prime Ministers had also
died, having first put off the burden of office, each at
the zenith of his popularity.  Of the two famous men
upon the Unionist side who remained when Lord
Salisbury tendered his resignation, the one since
1906 had been wholly withdrawn from public life,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
while the other, four years later, had passed the
leadership into younger hands.[<a id="chap0301fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
There is room for an almost infinite variety of
estimate as to the influence which is exercised by
pre-eminent characters upon public affairs and
national ideals.  The verdict of the day after is always
different from that of a year after.  The verdict of
the next generation, while differing from both, is apt
to be markedly different from that of the generation
which follows it.  The admiration or censure of the
moment is followed by a reaction no less surely than
the reaction itself is followed by a counter-reaction.
Gradually the oscillations become shorter, as matters
pass out of the hands of journalists and politicians
into those of the historian.  Possibly later judgments
are more true.  We have more knowledge, of a kind.
Seals are broken one by one, and we learn how this
man really thought and how the other acted, in both
cases differently from what had been supposed.  We
have new facts submitted to us, and possibly come
nearer the truth.  But while we gain so much, we
also lose in other directions.  We lose the sharp
savour of the air.  The keen glance and alert curiosity
of contemporary vigilance are lacking.  Conditions
and circumstances are no longer clear, and as
generation after generation passes away they become more
dim.  The narratives of the great historians and
novelists are to a large extent either faded or false.
We do not trust the most vivid presentments written
by the man of genius in his study a century after the
event, while we know well that even the shrewdest of
contemporaneous observers is certain to omit many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
of the essentials.  If Macaulay is inadequate in one
direction, Pepys is equally inadequate in another.
And if the chronicler at the moment, and the historian
in the future are not to be wholly believed, the writer
who comments after a decade or less upon things
which are fresh in his memory is liable to another
form of error; for either he is swept away by the full
current of the reaction, or else his judgments are
embittered by a sense of the hopelessness of swimming
against it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DEATH OF QUEEN VICTORIA
</span>
</p>

<p>
This much, however, may be said safely&mdash;that the
withdrawal of any pre-eminent character from the
scene, whether it be Queen Victoria or King Edward,
Lord Salisbury or Mr. Chamberlain, produces in a
greater or less degree that same loosening of allegiance
and disturbance of ideas, which are so much dreaded
by the conservative temperament from the removal
of an ancient institution.  For a pre-eminent
character is of the same nature as an institution.  The
beliefs, loyalties, and ideals of millions were attached
to the personality of the Queen.  The whole of that
prestige which Queen Victoria drew from the awe,
reverence, affection, and prayers of her people could
not be passed along with the crown to King Edward.
The office of sovereign was for the moment stripped
and impoverished of some part of its strength, and
was only gradually replenished as the new monarch
created a new, and to some extent a different, loyalty
of his own.  So much is a truism.  But, when there
is already a ferment in men's minds, the disappearance
in rapid succession of the pre-eminent characters of
the age helps on revolution by putting an end to a
multitude of customary attachments, and by setting
sentiments adrift to wander in search of new heroes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
</p>

<p>
A change of some importance had also come over
the character of the House of Commons.  The old
idea that it was a kind of grand jury of plain men,
capable in times of crisis of breaking with their parties,
had at last finally disappeared.  In politics there
was no longer any place for plain men.  The need
was for professionals, and professionals of this sort,
like experts in other walks of life, were worthy of
their hire.
</p>

<p>
The decision to pay members of Parliament came
as no surprise.  The marvel was rather that it
had not been taken at an earlier date, seeing that
for considerably more than a century this item had
figured in the programmes of all advanced reformers.
The change, nevertheless, when it came, was no
trivial occurrence, but one which was bound
fundamentally to affect the character of the popular
assembly; whether for better or worse was a matter
of dispute.
</p>

<p>
Immense, however, as were the possibilities
contained in the conversion of unpaid amateurs into
professional and stipendiary politicians, what excited
even more notice at the time than the thing itself,
were the means by which it was accomplished.  No
attempt was made to place this great constitutional
reform definitely and securely upon the statute book.
To have followed this course would have meant submitting
a bill, and a bill would have invited discussion
at all its various stages.  Moreover, the measure
might have been challenged by the House of Lords,
in which case delay would have ensued; and a subject,
peculiarly susceptible to malicious misrepresentation,
would have been kept&mdash;possibly for so long as three
years&mdash;under the critical eyes of public opinion.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
Apparently this beneficent proposal was one of those
instances, so rare in modern political life, where
neither publicity nor advertisement was sought.  On
the contrary, the object seemed to be to do good
by stealth; and for this purpose a simple financial
resolution was all that the law required.  The Lords
had recently been warned off and forbidden to
interfere with money matters, their judgment being
under suspicion, owing to its supposed liability to
be affected by motives of self-interest.  The House
of Commons was therefore sole custodian of the
public purse; and in this capacity its members were
invited to vote themselves four hundred pounds a
year all round, as the shortest and least ostentatious
way of raising the character and improving the
quality of the people's representatives.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
CHANGE IN HOUSE OF COMMONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Even by July 1914 the effect of this constitutional
amendment upon our old political traditions had
become noticeable in various directions.  But the
means by which it was accomplished are no less
worthy of note than the reform itself, when we are
endeavouring to estimate the changes which have
come over Parliament during this short but
revolutionary epoch.  The method adopted seemed to
indicate a novel attitude on the part of members
of the House of Commons towards the Imperial
Exchequer, on the part of the Government towards
members of the House of Commons, and on the part
of both towards the people whom they trusted.  It
was adroit, expeditious, and businesslike; and to this
extent seemed to promise well for years to come,
when the professionals should have finally got rid of
the amateurs, and taken things wholly into their
own hands.  Hostile critics, it is true, denounced the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
reform bluntly as corruption, and the method of its
achievement as furtive and cynical; but for this
class of persons no slander is ever too gross&mdash;<i>They
have said.  Quhat say they?  Let them be saying</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The party leaders were probably neither worse
men nor better than they had been in the past; but
they were certainly smaller; while on the other hand
the issues with which they found themselves
confronted were bigger.
</p>

<p>
Great characters are like tent-pegs.  One of their
uses is to prevent the political camp from being
blown to ribbons.  Where they are too short or too
frail, we may look for such disorders as have repeated
themselves at intervals during the past few years.
A blast of anger or ill-temper has blown, or a gust of
sentiment, or even a gentle zephyr of sentimentality,
and the whole scene has at once become a confusion
of flapping canvas, tangled cordage, and shouting,
struggling humanity.  Such unstable conditions are
fatal to equanimity; they disturb the fortitude of
the most stalwart follower, and cause doubt and
distrust on every hand.
</p>

<p>
Since the Liberal Government came into power
in the autumn of 1905, neither of the great parties
had succeeded in earning the respect of the other;
and as the nature of man is not subject to violent
fluctuations, it may safely be concluded that this
misfortune had been due either to some defect or
inadequacy of leadership, or else to conditions of an
altogether extraordinary character.
</p>

<p>
During these ten sessions the bulk of the statute
book had greatly increased, and much of this increase
was no doubt healthy tissue.  This period, notwithstanding,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
will ever dwell in the memory as a squalid
episode.  Especially is this the case when we contrast
the high hopes and promises, not of one party alone,
with the results which were actually achieved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DEMOCRACY AND LEADERSHIP
</span>
</p>

<p>
Democracy, if the best, is also the most delicate
form of human government.  None suffers so swiftly
or so sorely from any shortage in the crop of character.
None is so dependent upon men, and so little capable
of being supported by the machine alone.  When
the leading of parties is in the hands of those who
lack vision and firmness, the first effect which manifests
itself is that parties begin to slip their principles.
Some secondary object calls for and obtains the
sacrifice of an ideal.  So the Unionists in 1909 threw
over the order and tradition of the state, the very
ark of their political covenant, when they procured
the rejection of the Budget by the House of Lords.
So the Liberal Government in 1910, having solemnly
undertaken to reform the constitution&mdash;a work not
unworthy of the most earnest endeavour&mdash;went back
upon their word, and abandoned their original
purpose.  For one thing they grew afraid of the clamour
of their partisans.  For another they were tempted
by the opportunity of advantages which&mdash;as they
fondly imagined&mdash;could be easily and safely secured
during the interval while all legislative powers were
temporarily vested in the Commons.  Nor were
these the only instances where traditional policy had
been diverted, and where ideals had been bargained
away, in the hope that thereby objects of a more
material sort might be had at once in exchange.
</p>

<p>
The business of leadership is to prevent the
abandonment of the long aim for the sake of the short.
The rank and file of every army is at all times most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
dangerously inclined to this fatal temptation, not
necessarily dishonestly, but from a lack of foresight
and sense of proportion.
</p>

<p>
Some dim perception of cause and effect had begun
to dawn during the years 1912 and 1913 upon the
country, and even upon the more sober section of the
politicians.  An apprehension had been growing
rapidly, and defied concealment, that the country
was faced by a very formidable something, to which
men hesitated to give a name, but which was clearly
not to be got rid of by the customary methods of
holding high debates about it, and thereafter marching
into division lobbies.  While in public, each party
was concerned to attribute the appearance of this
unwelcome monster solely to the misdeeds of their
opponents, each party knew well enough in their
hearts that the danger was due at least in some
measure to their own abandonment of pledges,
principles, and traditions.
</p>

<p>
At Midsummer 1914 most people would probably
have said that the immediate peril was Ireland and
civil war.  A few months earlier many imagined that
trouble of a more general character was brewing
between the civil and military powers, and that an
issue which they described as that of 'the Army
versus the People' would have to be faced.  A few
years earlier there was a widespread fear that the
country might be confronted by some organised
stoppage of industry, and that this would lead to
revolution.  Throughout the whole of this period of
fourteen years the menace of war with Germany had
been appearing, and disappearing, and reappearing,
very much as a whale shows his back, dives, rises at
some different spot, and dives again.  For the moment,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
however, this particular anxiety did not weigh
heavily on the public mind.  The man in the street
had been assured of late by the greater part of the
press and politicians&mdash;even by ministers themselves&mdash;that
our relations with this formidable neighbour were
friendlier and more satisfactory than they had been
for some considerable time.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MR. ASQUITH'S PRE-EMINENCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
At Midsummer 1914, that is to say about six
weeks before war broke out, the pre-eminent character
in British politics was the Prime Minister.  No other
on either side of the House approached him in
prestige, and so much was freely admitted by foes
as well as friends.
</p>

<p>
When we are able to arrive at a fair estimate of
the man who is regarded as the chief figure of his
age, we have an important clue to the aspirations
and modes of thought of the period in which he lived.
A people may be known to some extent by the leaders
whom it has chosen to follow.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Asquith entered Parliament in 1886, and
before many months had passed his reputation was
secure.  Mr. Gladstone, ever watchful for youthful
talent, promoted him at a bound to be Home Secretary,
when the Cabinet of 1892 came into precarious
existence.  No member of this government justified
his selection more admirably.  But the period of
office was brief.  Three years later, the Liberal
party found itself once again in the wilderness, where
it continued to wander, rent by dissensions both as
to persons and principles, for rather more than a
decade.
</p>

<p>
When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman returned
to office in the autumn of 1905, Mr. Asquith became
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was speedily
accepted as the minister next in succession to his
chief.  He was then just turned fifty, so that,
despite the delays which had occurred, it could not be
said that fortune had behaved altogether unkindly.
Two and a half years later, in April 1908, he
succeeded to the premiership without a rival, and
without a dissentient voice.
</p>

<p>
The ambition, however, which brought him so
successfully to the highest post appeared to have
exhausted a great part of its force in attainment, and
to have left its possessor without sufficient energy
for exercising those functions which the post itself
required.  The career of Mr. Asquith in the highest
office reminds one a little of the fable of the Hare and
the Tortoise.  In the race which we all run with
slow-footed fate, he had a signal advantage in the speed of
his intellect, in his capacity for overtaking arrears
of work which would have appalled any other minister,
and for finding, on the spur of the moment, means for
extricating his administration from the most threatening
positions.  But of late, like the Hare, he had
come to believe himself invincible, and had yielded
more and more to a drowsy inclination.  He had
seemed to fall asleep for long periods, apparently in
serene confidence that, before the Tortoise could
pass the winning-post, somebody or something&mdash;in
all probability the Unionist party with the clamour
of a premature jubilation&mdash;would awaken him in
time to save the race.
</p>

<p>
So far as Parliament was concerned, his confidence
in his own qualities was not misplaced.  Again
and again, the unleadered energies or ungoaded
indolence of his colleagues landed the Government
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
in a mess.  But as often as this happened Mr. Asquith
always advanced upon the scene and rescued his
party, by putting the worst blunder in the best light.
He obligingly picked his stumbling lieutenants out
of the bogs into which&mdash;largely, it must be admitted,
for want of proper guidance from their chief&mdash;they
had had the misfortune to fall.  Having done this in
the most chivalrous manner imaginable, he earned
their gratitude and devotion.  In this way he
maintained a firm hold upon the leadership; if indeed
it can properly be termed leadership to be the best
acrobat of the troupe, and to step forward and do the
feats after your companions have failed, and the
audience has begun to 'boo.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
WAIT AND SEE
</span>
</p>

<p>
Some years ago Mr. Asquith propounded a
maxim&mdash;<i>wait-and-see</i>&mdash;which greatly scandalised and annoyed
the other side.  This formula was the perfectly natural
expression of his character and policy.  In the peculiar
circumstances of the case it proved itself to be a
successful parliamentary expedient.  Again and again
it wrought confusion among his simple-minded
opponents, who&mdash;not being held together by any firm
authority&mdash;followed their own noses, now in one
direction, now in another, upon the impulse of the
moment.  It is probable that against a powerful
leader, who had his party well in hand, this policy of
makeshift and delay would have brought its author
to grief.  But Unionists were neither disciplined nor
united, and they had lacked leadership ever since
they entered upon opposition.
</p>

<p>
For all its excellency, Mr. Asquith's oratory never
touched the heart.  And very rarely indeed did it
succeed in convincing the cool judgment of people
who had experience at first hand of the matters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
under discussion.  There was lacking anything in
the nature of a personal note, which might have
related the ego of the speaker to the sentiments
which he announced so admirably.  Also there was
something which suggested that his knowledge had
not been gained by looking at the facts face to face;
but rather by the rapid digestion of minutes and
memoranda, which had been prepared for him by
clerks and secretaries, and which purported to provide,
in convenient tabloids, all that it was necessary
for a parliamentarian to know.
</p>

<p>
The style of speaking which is popular nowadays,
and of which Mr. Asquith is by far the greatest
master, would not have been listened to with an equal
favour in the days of our grandfathers.  In the
Parliaments which assembled at Westminster in the
period between the passing of the Reform Bill and
the founding of the Eighty Club,[<a id="chap0301fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn11">11</a>] the
country-gentlemen and the men-of-business&mdash;two classes of
humanity who are constantly in touch with, and
drawing strength from, our mother earth of hard
fact[<a id="chap0301fn12text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn12">12</a>]&mdash;met and fought out their differences during two
generations.  In that golden age it was all but
unthinkable that a practising barrister should ever
have become Prime Minister.  The legal profession
at this time had but little influence in counsel; still
less in Parliament and on the platform.  The middle
classes were every whit as jealous and distrustful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
of the intervention of the lawyer-advocate in public
affairs as the landed gentry themselves.  But in the
stage of democratic evolution, which we entered on
the morrow of the Mid-Lothian campaigns, and in
which we still remain, the popular, and even the
parliamentary, audience has gradually ceased to
consist mainly of country-gentlemen interested in the
land, and of the middle-classes who are engaged in
trade.  It has grown to be at once less discriminating
as to the substance of speeches, and more exacting
as to their form.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
POLITICAL LAWYERS
</span>
</p>

<p>
A representative assembly which entirely lacked
lawyers would be impoverished; but one in which
they are the predominant, or even a very important
element, is usually in its decline.  It is strange that
an order of men, who in their private and professional
capacities are so admirable, should nevertheless
produce baleful effects when they come to play too great
a part in public affairs.  Trusty friends, delightful
companions, stricter perhaps than any other civil
profession in all rules of honour, they are none the
less, without seeking to be so, the worst enemies of
representative institutions.  The peculiar danger of
personal monarchy is that it so easily submits to
draw its inspiration from an adulatory priesthood,
and the peculiar danger of that modern form of
constitutional government which we call democracy, is
that lawyers, with the most patriotic intentions, are
so apt to undo it.
</p>

<p>
Lawyers see too much of life in one way, too little
in another, to make them safe guides in practical
matters.  Their experience of human affairs is made
up of an infinite number of scraps cut out of other
people's lives.  They learn and do hardly anything
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
except through intermediaries.  Their clients are
introduced, not in person, but in the first instance,
on paper&mdash;through the medium of solicitors'
'instructions.'  Litigants appear at consultations in their
counsel's chambers under the chaperonage of their
attorneys; their case is considered; they receive
advice.  Then perhaps, if the issue comes into court,
they appear once again, in the witness-box, and are
there examined, cross-examined, and re-examined
under that admirable system for the discovery of
truth which is ordained in Anglo-Saxon countries,
and which consists in turning, for the time being,
nine people in every ten out of their true natures
into hypnotised rabbits.  Then the whole thing is
ended, and the client disappears into the void from
whence he came.  What happens to him afterwards
seldom reaches the ears of his former counsel.  Whether
the advice given to him in consultation has proved
right or wrong in practice, rarely becomes known to
the great man who gave it.
</p>

<p>
Plausibility, an alert eye for the technical trip or
fall&mdash;the great qualities of an advocate&mdash;do not
necessarily imply judgment of the most valuable
sort outside courts of law.  The farmer who manures,
ploughs, harrows, sows, and rolls in his crop is punished
in his income, if he has done any one of these things
wrongly, or at the wrong season.  The shopkeeper
who blunders in his buying or his selling, or the
manufacturer who makes things as they should not
be made, suffers painful consequences to a certainty.
His error pounds him relentlessly on the head.  Not
so the lawyer.  His errors for the most part are visited
on others.  His own success or non-success is largely
a matter of words and pose.  If he is confident and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
adroit, the dulness of the jury or the senility of the
bench can be made to appear, in the eyes of the
worsted client, as the true causes of his defeat.  And
the misfortune is that in politics, which under its
modern aspect is a trade very much akin to
advocacy, there is a temptation, with all but the most
patriotic lawyers, to turn to account at Westminster
the skill which they have so laboriously acquired in
the Temple.
</p>

<p>
Of course there have been, and will ever be,
exceptions.  Alexander Hamilton was a lawyer,
though he was a soldier in the first instance.  Abraham
Lincoln was a lawyer.  But we should have to go
back to the 'glorious revolution' of 1688 before we
could find a parallel to either of these two in our own
history.  Until the last two decades England has
never looked favourably on lawyer leaders.  This
was regarded by some as a national peculiarity; by
others as a safeguard of our institutions.  But by
the beginning of the twentieth century it was clear
that lawyers had succeeded in establishing their
predominance in the higher walks of English politics,
as thoroughly as they had already done wherever
parliamentary government exists throughout the
world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MR. ASQUITH'S ORATORY
</span>
</p>

<p>
During this epoch, when everything was sacrificed
to perspicuity and the avoidance of boredom,
Mr. Asquith's utterances led the fashion.  His ministry
was composed to a large extent of politicians bred
in the same profession and proficient in the same
arts as himself; but he towered above them all, the
supreme type of the lawyer-statesman.
</p>

<p>
His method was supremely skilful.  In its own
way it had the charm of perfect artistry, even though
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
the product of the art was hardly more permanent
than that of the <i>cordon bleu</i> who confections ices in
fancy patterns.  And not only was the method well
suited to the taste of popular audiences, but equally
so to the modern House of Commons.  That body,
also, was now much better educated in matters which
can be learned out of newspapers and books; far
more capable of expressing its meanings in
well-chosen phrases arranged in a logical sequence; far
more critical of words&mdash;if somewhat less observant
of things&mdash;than it was during the greater part of the
reign of Queen Victoria.
</p>

<p>
To a large extent the House of Commons consisted
of persons with whom public utterance was a trade.
There were lawyers in vast numbers, journalists,
political organisers, and professional lecturers on a
large variety of subjects.  And even among the
labour party, where we might have expected to find
a corrective, the same tendency was at work, perhaps
as strongly as in any other quarter.  For although
few types of mankind have a shrewder judgment
between reality and dialectic than a thoroughly
competent 'workman,' labour leaders were not
chosen because they were first-class workmen, but
because they happened to be effective speakers on
the platform or at the committee table.
</p>

<p>
To a critic, looking on at the play from outside,
Mr. Asquith's oratory appeared to lack heart
and the instinct for reality; his leadership, the
qualities of vigilance, steadfastness, and authority.
He did not prevail by personal force, but by
adroit confutation.  His debating, as distinguished
from his political, courage would have been
admitted with few reservations even by an opponent.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
Few were so ready to meet their enemies in the
gate of discussion.  Few, if any, were so capable of
retrieving the fortunes of their party&mdash;even when
things looked blackest&mdash;if it were at all possible to
accomplish this by the weapons of debate.  But the
medium must be debate&mdash;not action or counsel&mdash;if
Mr. Asquith's pre-eminence was to assert itself.  In
debate he had all the confidence and valour of the
<i>matre d'armes</i>, who knows himself to be the superior
in skill of any fencer in his own school.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
HIS CHARACTER
</span>
</p>

<p>
Next to Lord Rosebery he was the figure of most
authority among the Liberal Imperialists, and yet
this did not sustain his resolution when the Cabinet
of 1905 proceeded to pare down the naval estimates.
He was the champion of equal justice, as regards the
status of Trades Unions, repelling the idea of
exceptional and favouring legislation with an eloquent
scorn.  Yet he continued to hold his place when his
principles were thrown overboard by his colleagues
in 1906.  Again when he met Parliament in February
1910 he announced his programme with an air of
heroic firmness.[<a id="chap0301fn13text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn13">13</a>]  It is unnecessary to recall the
particulars of this episode, and how he was upheld
in his command only upon condition that he would
alter his course to suit the wishes of mutineers.
And in regard to the question of Home Rule, his
treatment of it from first to last had been
characterised by the virtues of patience and humility,
rather than by those of prescience or courage.
</p>

<p>
A 'stellar and undiminishable' something, around
which the qualities and capacities of a man revolve
obediently, and under harmonious restraint&mdash;like
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
the planetary bodies&mdash;is perhaps as near as we can
get to a definition of human greatness.  But in the
case of Mr. Asquith, for some years prior to July 1914,
the central force of his nature had seemed inadequate
for imposing the law of its will upon those brilliant
satellites his talents.  As a result, the solar system
of his character had fallen into confusion, and
especially since the opening of that year had appeared to
be swinging lop-sided across the political firmament
hastening to inevitable disaster.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
THREE GOVERNING IDEAS
</h3>

<p>
At the death of Queen Victoria the development
of the British Commonwealth entered upon a new
phase.  The epoch which followed has no precedent
in our own previous experience as a nation, nor can
we discover in the records of other empires anything
which offers more than a superficial and misleading
resemblance to it.  The issues of this period presented
themselves to different minds in a variety of different
lights; but to all it was clear that we had reached
one of the great turning-points in our history.
</p>

<p>
The passengers on a great ocean liner are apt to
imagine, because their stomachs are now so little
troubled by the perturbation of the waves, that it
no longer profits them to offer up the familiar prayer
'for those in peril on the sea.'  It is difficult for them
to believe in danger where everything appears so
steady and well-ordered, and where they can enjoy
most of the distractions of urban life, from a
cinematograph theatre to a skittle-alley, merely by
descending a gilded staircase or crossing a brightly
panelled corridor.  But this agreeable sense of safety
is perhaps due in a greater degree to fancy, than to the
changes which have taken place in the essential facts.
As dangers have been diminished in one direction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
risks have been incurred in another.  A blunder to-day
is more irreparable than formerly, and the havoc
which ensues upon a blunder is vastly more appalling.
An error of observation or of judgment&mdash;the wrong
lever pulled or the wrong button pressed&mdash;an order
which miscarries or is overlooked&mdash;and twenty
thousand tons travelling at twenty knots an hour
goes to the bottom, with its freight of humanity,
merchandise, and treasure, more easily, and with
greater speed and certainty, than in the days of the
old galleons&mdash;than in the days when Drake, in the
<i>Golden Hind</i> of a hundred tons burden, beat up against
head winds in the Straits of Magellan, and ran before
the following gale off the Cape of Storms.
</p>

<p>
Comfort, whether in ships of travel or of state, is
not the same thing as security.  It never has been,
and it never will be.
</p>

<p>
The position after Queen Victoria's death also
differed from all previous times in another way.
After more than three centuries of turmoil and expansion,
the British race had entered into possession of
an estate so vast, so rich in all natural resources, that
a sane mind could not hope for, or even dream of,
any further aggrandisement.  Whatever may be the
diseases from which the British race suffered during
the short epoch between January 1901 and July 1914,
megalomania was certainly not one of them.
</p>

<p>
The period of acquisition being now acknowledged
at an end, popular imagination became much occupied
with other things.  It assumed, too lightly and
readily perhaps, that nothing was likely to interfere
with our continuing to hold what we had got.  If there
was not precisely a law of nature, which precluded
the possessions of the British Empire from ever being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
taken away, at any rate there was the law of nations.
The public opinion of the world would surely revolt
against so heinous a form of sacrilege.  Having
assumed so much, placidly and contentedly, and
without even a tremor either as to the good-will or
the potency of the famous Concert of Europe, the
larger part of public opinion tended to become more
and more engrossed in other problems.  It began to
concern itself earnestly with <i>the improvement of the
condition of the people</i>, and with <i>the reform and
consolidation of institutions</i>.  Incidentally, and as
a part of each of these endeavours, the development
of an estate which had come, mainly by inheritance,
into the trusteeship of the British people, began
seriously to occupy their thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
SOCIAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
</span>
</p>

<p>
These were problems of great worth and dignity, but
nevertheless there was one condition of their successful
solution, which ought to have been kept in mind,
but which possibly was somewhat overlooked.  If we
allowed ourselves to be so much absorbed by these two
problems that we gave insufficient heed to our defences,
it was as certain as any human forecast could be, that
the solution of a great deal, which was perplexing
us in the management of our internal affairs, would
be summarily taken out of the hands of Britain and
her Dominions and solved according to the ideas of
strangers.
</p>

<p>
If we were to bring our policy of social and
constitutional improvement and the development
of our estate to a successful issue, we must be safe
from interruption from outside.  We must secure
ourselves against foreign aggression; for we needed
time.  Our various problems could not be solved
in a day or even in a generation.  The most urgent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
of all matters was <i>security</i>, for it was the prime
condition of all the rest.
</p>

<p>
We desired, not merely to hold what we had got,
but to enjoy it, and make it fructify and prosper, in
our own way, and under our own institutions.  For
this we needed peace within our own sphere; and
therefore it was necessary that we should be strong
enough to enforce peace.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During the post-Victorian period&mdash;this short epoch
of transition&mdash;there were therefore three separate
sets of problems which between them absorbed the
energies of public men and occupied the thoughts of
all private persons, at home and in the Dominions,
to whom the present and future well-being of their
country was a matter of concern.
</p>

<p>
The first of these problems was <i>Defence</i>: How
might the British Commonwealth, which held so
vast a portion of the habitable globe, and which was
responsible for the government of a full quarter of
all the people who dwelt thereon&mdash;how might it best
secure itself against the dangers which threatened
it from without?
</p>

<p>
The second was the problem of <i>the Constitution</i>:
How could we best develop, to what extent must we
remake or remould, our ancient institutions, so as
to fit them for those duties and responsibilities which
new conditions required that they should be able to
perform?  Under this head we were faced with
projects, not merely of local self-government, of
'Home Rule,' and of 'Federalism'; not merely
with the working of the Parliament Act, with the
composition, functions, and powers of the Second
Chamber, with the Referendum, the Franchise, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
such like; but also with that vast and even more
perplexing question&mdash;what were to be the future
relations between the Mother Country and the
self-governing Dominions on the one hand, and between
these five democratic nations and the Indian Empire
and the Dependencies upon the other?
</p>

<p>
For the third set of problems no concise title has
yet been found.  <i>Social Reform</i> does not cover it,
though perhaps it comes nearer doing so than any
other.  The matters involved here were so multifarious
and, apparently at least, so detached one from
another&mdash;they presented themselves to different minds at so
many different angles and under such different
aspects&mdash;that no single word or phrase was altogether
satisfactory.  But briefly, what all men were engaged in
searching after&mdash;the Labour party, no more and no
less than the Radicals and the Tories&mdash;was how we
could raise the character and material conditions of
our people; how by better organisation we could root
out needless misery of mind and body; how we could
improve the health and the intelligence, stimulate
the sense of duty and fellowship, the efficiency and
the patriotism of the whole community.
</p>

<p>
Of these three sets of problems with which the
British race has recently been occupying itself, this,
the third, is intrinsically by far the most important.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL REFORM
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is the most important because it is an end in
itself whereas the other two are only the means for
achieving this end.  Security against foreign attack
is a desirable and worthy object only in order to
enable us to approach this goal.  A strong and flexible
constitution is an advantage only because we believe
it will enable us to achieve our objects, better and
more quickly, than if we are compelled to go on working
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
under a system which has become at once rigid and
rickety.  But while we were bound to realise the
superior nature of the third set of problems, we should
have been careful at the same time to distinguish
between two things which are very apt to be confused
in political discussions&mdash;<i>ultimate importance</i>
and <i>immediate urgency</i>.
</p>

<p>
We ought to have taken into our reckoning both
the present state of the world and the permanent
nature of man&mdash;all the stuff that dreams and wars
are made on.  We desired peace.  We needed peace.
Peace was a matter of life and death to all our hopes.
If defeat should once break into the ring of our
commonwealth&mdash;scattered as it is all over the world,
kept together only by the finest and most delicate
attachments&mdash;it must be broken irreparably.  Our
most immediate interest was therefore to keep defeat,
and if possible, war, from bursting into our sphere&mdash;as
Dutchmen by centuries of laborious vigilance have
kept back the sea with dikes.
</p>

<p>
The numbers of our people in themselves were no
security; nor our riches; nor even the fact that
we entertained no aggressive designs.  For as it was
said long ago, 'it never troubles a wolf how many the
sheep be.'  They find no salvation in their heavy
fleeces and their fat haunches; nor even in the
meekness of their hearts, and in their innocence of
all evil intentions.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The characteristic of this period may be summed
up in one short sentence; the vast majority of the
British people were bent and determined&mdash;as they
had never been bent and determined before&mdash;upon
leaving their country better than they had found it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
</p>

<p>
To some this statement will seem a paradox.
"Was there ever a time," they may ask, "when
there had been so many evidences of popular unrest,
discontent, bitterness and anger; or when there had
ever appeared to be so great an inclination, on the
one hand to apathy and cynicism, on the other
hand to despair?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE RESULTS OF CONFUSION
</span>
</p>

<p>
Were all this true, it would still be no paradox;
but only a natural consequence.  Things are very
liable to slip into this state, when men who are
in earnest&mdash;knowing the facts as they exist in
their respective spheres; knowing the evils at first
hand; believing (very often with reason) that they
understand the true remedies&mdash;find themselves
baulked, and foiled, and headed off at every turn,
their objects misconceived and their motives
misconstrued, and the current of their wasted efforts
burying itself hopelessly in the sand.  Under such
conditions as these, public bodies and political parties
alike&mdash;confused by the multitude and congestion of
issues&mdash;are apt to bestow their dangerous attentions,
now on one matter which happens to dart into the
limelight, now upon another; but in the general
hubbub and perplexity they lose all sense, both of
true proportion and natural priority.  Everything
is talked about; much is attempted in a piecemeal,
slap-dash, impulsive fashion; inconsiderably little
is brought to any conclusion whatsoever; while
nothing, or next to nothing, is considered on its
merits, and carried through thoughtfully to a clean
and abiding settlement....  The word 'thorough'
seemed to have dropped out of the political vocabulary.
In an age of specialism politics alone was abandoned
to the Jack-of-all-trades.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
</p>

<p>
This phenomenon&mdash;the depreciated currency of
public character&mdash;was not peculiar to one party more
than another.  It was not even peculiar to this
particular time.  It has shown itself at various
epochs&mdash;much in the same way as the small-pox and
the plague&mdash;when favoured by insanitary conditions.
The sedate Scots philosopher, Adam Smith, writing
during the gloomy period which fell upon England
after the glory of the great Chatham had departed,
could not repress his bitterness against "that insidious
and crafty animal, vulgarly called a statesman
or politician, whose councils are directed by the
momentary fluctuations of affairs."  It would seem
as if the body politic is not unlike the human, and
becomes more readily a prey to vermin, when it has
sunk into a morbid condition.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Popular judgment may be trusted as a rule, and
in the long run, to decide a clear issue between truth
and falsehood, and to decide it in favour of the
former.  But it becomes perplexed, when it is called
upon to discriminate between the assurances of two
rival sets of showmen, whose eagerness to outbid
each other in the public favour leaves truthfulness
out of account.  In the absence of gold, one brazen
counterfeit rings very much like another.  People
may be suspicious of both coins; but on the whole
their fancy is more readily caught by the optimist
effigy than the pessimist.  They may not place
entire trust in the 'ever-cheerful man of sin,' with
his flattery, his abounding sympathy, his flowery
promises, and his undefeated hopefulness; but
they prefer him at any rate to 'the melancholy
Jaques,' booming maledictions with a mournful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
constancy, like some bittern in the desolation of the
marshes.
</p>

<p>
So far as principles were concerned most of the
trouble was unnecessary.  Among the would-be
reformers&mdash;among those who sincerely desired to
bring about efficiency within their own spheres&mdash;there
was surprisingly little that can truly be called
antagonism.  But competition of an important
kind&mdash;competition for public attention and priority
of treatment&mdash;had produced many of the unfortunate
results of antagonism.  It was inevitable that this
lamentable state of things must continue, until it
had been realised that one small body of men, elected
upon a variety of cross issues, could not safely be left
in charge of the defence of the Empire, the domestic
welfare of the United Kingdom, and the local
government of its several units.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ARTIFICIAL ANTAGONISMS
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was not merely that the various aims were not
opposed to one another; they were actually helpful
to one another.  Often, indeed, they were essential
to the permanent success of one another.  The man
who desired to improve the conditions of the poor was
not, therefore, the natural enemy of him who wanted
to place the national defences on a secure footing.
And neither of these was the natural enemy of others
who wished to bring about a settlement of the Irish
question, or of the Constitutional question, or of the
Imperial question.  But owing partly to the
inadequacy of the machinery for giving a free course to
these various aspirations&mdash;partly to the fact that the
machinery itself was antiquated, in bad repair, and
had become clogged with a variety of obstructions&mdash;there
was an unfortunate tendency on the part of
every one who had any particular object very much
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
at heart, to regard every one else who was equally
concerned about any other object as an impediment
in his path.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The need of the time, of course, was leadership&mdash;a
great man&mdash;or better still two great men, one on
each side&mdash;like the blades of a pair of scissors&mdash;to
cut a way out of the confusion by bringing their keen
edges into contact.  But obviously, the greater the
confusion the harder it is for leadership to assert itself.  We
may be sure enough that there were men of character
and capacity equal to the task if only they could have
been discovered.  But they were not discovered.
</p>

<p>
There were other things besides the confusion
of aims and ideas which made it hard for leaders to
emerge.  The loose coherency of parties which
prevailed during the greater part of the nineteenth
century had given place to a set of highly organised
machines, which employed without remorse the
oriental method of strangulation, against everything
in the nature of independent effort and judgment.
The politician class had increased greatly in numbers
and influence.  The eminent and ornamental people
who were returned to Westminster filled the public
eye, but they were only a small proportion of the
whole; nor is it certain that they exercised the
largest share of authority.  When in the autumn
of 1913 Sir John Brunner determined to prevent
Mr. Churchill from obtaining the provisions for the
Navy which were judged necessary for the safety
of the Empire, the method adopted was to raise the
National Liberal Federation against the First Lord
of the Admiralty, and through the agency of that
powerful organisation to bring pressure to bear
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
upon the country, members of Parliament, and the
Cabinet itself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
BAD MONEY DRIVES OUT GOOD
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is unpopular to say that the House of Commons
has deteriorated in character, but it is true.  An
assembly, the members of which cannot call their
souls their own, will never tend in an upward
direction.  The machines which are managed with so
much energy and skill by the external parasites of
politics, have long ago taken over full responsibility
for the souls of their nominees.  According to
'Gresham's law,' bad money, if admitted into currency,
will always end by driving out good.  A similar
principle has been at work for some time past in
British public life, by virtue of which the baser kind
of politicians, having got a footing, are driving out
their betters at a rapid pace.  Few members of
Parliament will admit this fact; but they are not
impartial judges, for every one is naturally averse
from disparaging an institution to which he belongs.
</p>

<p>
During the nineteenth century, except at the very
beginning, and again at the very end of it, very few
people ever thought of going into Parliament, or
even into politics, in order that they might thrive
thereby, or find a field for improving their private
fortunes.  This cannot be said with truth of the
epoch which has just ended.  There has been a change
both in tone and outlook during the last thirty years.
Things have been done and approved by the House
of Commons, elected in December 1910, which it
is quite inconceivable that the House of Commons,
returned in 1880, would ever have entertained.  The
Gladstonian era had its faults, but among them laxity
in matters of finance did not figure.  Indeed private
members, as well as statesmen, not infrequently
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
crossed the border-line which separates purism from
pedantry; occasionally they carried strictness to the
verge of absurdity; but this was a fault in the right
direction&mdash;a great safeguard to the public interest,
a peculiarly valuable tendency from the standpoint
of democracy.
</p>

<p>
A twelvemonth ago a number of very foolish
persons were anxious to persuade us that the
predominant issue was the Army <i>versus</i> the People.
But even the crispness of the phrase was powerless
to convince public opinion of so staggering an
untruth.  The predominant issue at that particular
moment was only what it had been for a good many
years before&mdash;the People <i>versus</i> the Party System.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NEED OF RICH MEN
</span>
</p>

<p>
What is apt to be ignored is, that with the increase
of wealth on the one hand, and the extension of the
franchise on the other, the Party System has gradually
become a vested interest upon an enormous scale,&mdash;like
the liquor trade of which we hear so much,
or the <i>haute finance</i> of which perhaps we hear too little.
Rich men are required in politics, for the reason that
it is necessary to feed and clothe the steadily
increasing swarms of mechanics who drive, and keep
in repair, and add to, that elaborate machinery by
means of which the Sovereign People is cajoled into
the belief that its Will prevails.  From the point of
view of the orthodox political economist these workers
are as unproductive as actors, bookmakers, or golf
professionals; but they have to be paid, otherwise
they would starve, and the machines would stop.
So long as there are plenty of rich men who desire
to become even richer, or to decorate their names
with titles, or to move in shining circles, this is
not at all likely to occur, unless the Party System
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
suddenly collapsed, in which case there would be
acute distress.
</p>

<p>
There are various grades of these artisans or
mechanicians of politics, from the professional
organiser or agent who, upon the whole, is no more
open to criticism than any other class of mankind
which works honestly for its living&mdash;down to the
committee-man who has no use for a candidate unless
he keeps a table from which large crumbs fall in
profusion.  The man who supplements his income
by means of politics is a greater danger than the other
who openly makes politics his vocation.  The jobbing
printer, enthusiastically pacifist or protectionist, well
paid for his hand-bills, and aspiring to more
substantial contracts; the smart, ingratiating organiser,
or hustling, bustling journalist, who receives a
complimentary cheque, or a bundle of scrip, or a seat on
a board of directors from the patron whom he has
helped to win an election&mdash;very much as at
ill-regulated shooting parties the head-keeper receives
exorbitant tips from wealthy sportsmen whom he
has placed to their satisfaction&mdash;all these are deeply
interested in the preservation of the Party System.
Innocent folk are often heard wondering why
candidates with such strange names&mdash;even stranger
appearance&mdash;accents and manner of speech which are
strangest of all&mdash;are brought forward so frequently
to woo the suffrages of urban constituencies.  Clearly
they are not chosen on account of their political
knowledge; for they have none.  There are other
aspirants to political honours who, in comeliness
and charm of manner, greatly excel them; whose
speech is more eloquent, or at any rate less
unintelligible.  Yet London caucuses in particular have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
a great tenderness for these bejewelled patriots, and
presumably there must be reasons for the preference
which they receive.  One imagines that in some
inscrutable way they are essential props of the Party
System in its modern phase.
</p>

<p>
The drawing together of the world by steam and
electricity has brought conspicuous benefits to the
British Empire.  The five self-governing nations of
which it is composed come closer together year by
year.  Statesmen and politicians broaden the horizons
of their minds by swift and easy travel.  But there
are drawbacks as well as the reverse under these new
conditions.  To some extent the personnel of
democracy has tended to become interchangeable, like the
parts of a bicycle; and public characters are able to
transfer their activities from one state to another,
and even from one hemisphere to another, without a
great deal of difficulty.  This has certain advantages,
but possibly more from the point of view of the
individual than from that of the Commonwealth.
After failure in one sphere there is still hope in another.
Mr. Micawber, or even Jeremy Diddler, may go the
round, using up public confidence at one resting-place
after another.  For the Party System is a ready
employer, and providing a man has a glib tongue, a
forehead of brass, or an open purse, a position will
be found for him without too much enquiry made
into his previous references.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LAWYERISM AND LEADERSHIP
</span>
</p>

<p>
In a world filled with confusion and illusion the
Party System has fought at great advantage.  Indeed
it is generally believed to be so firmly entrenched
that nothing can ever dislodge it.  There are dangers,
however, in arguing too confidently from use and
wont.  Conspicuous failure or disaster might bring
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
ruin on this revered institution, as it has often done
in history upon others no less venerable.  The Party
System has its weak side.  Its wares are mainly
make-believes, and if a hurricane happens to burst
suddenly, the caucus may be left in no better plight
than Alnaschar with his overturned basket.  The
Party System is not invulnerable against a great man
or a great idea.  But of recent years it has been left
at peace to go its own way, for the reason that no such
man or idea has emerged, around which the English
people have felt that they could cluster confidently.
There has been no core on which human crystals
could precipitate and attach themselves, following
the bent of their nature towards a firm and clear
belief&mdash;or towards the prowess of a man&mdash;or towards
a Man possessed by a Belief.  The typical party
leader during this epoch has neither been a man in
the heroic sense, nor has he had any belief that could
be called firm or clear.  For the most part he has been
merely a Whig or Tory tradesman, dealing in
opportunism; and for the predominance of the Party System
this set of conditions was almost ideal.  It was
inconceivable that a policy of wait-and-see could ever
resolve a situation of this sort.  To fall back on
lawyerism was perhaps inevitable in the circumstances;
but to think that it was possible to substitute
lawyerism for leadership was absurd.
</p>

<p>
And yet amid this confusion we were aware&mdash;even
at the time&mdash;and can see much more clearly
now the interlude is ended&mdash;that there were three
great ideas running through it all, struggling to
emerge, to make themselves understood, and to get
themselves realised.  But unfortunately what were
realities to ordinary men were only counters according
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
to the reckoning of the party mechanicians.  The
<i>first</i> aim and the <i>second</i>&mdash;the improvement of the
organisation of society and the conditions of the
poor&mdash;the freeing of local aspirations and the knitting
together of the empire&mdash;were held in common by
the great mass of the British people, although they
were viewed by one section and another from different
angles of vision.  The <i>third</i> aim, however&mdash;the
adequate defence of the empire&mdash;was not regarded
warmly, or even with much active interest, by any
organised section.  The people who considered it
most earnestly were not engaged in party politics.
The manipulators of the machines looked upon the
<i>first</i> and the <i>second</i> as means whereby power might
be gained or retained, but they looked askance upon
the <i>third</i> as a perilous problem which it was wiser
and safer to leave alone.  The great principles with
which the names&mdash;among others&mdash;of Mr. Chamberlain,
Lord Roberts, and Mr. Lloyd George are associated,
were at no point opposed one to another.  Each
indeed was dependent upon the other two for its full
realisation.  And yet, under the artificial entanglements
of the Party System, the vigorous pursuit of
any one of the three seemed to imperil the success
of both its competitors.

CHAPTER III
<br />
POLICY AND ARMAMENTS
</h3>

<p>
In the post-Victorian epoch, which we have been
engaged in considering, the aim of British foreign
policy may be summed up in one word&mdash;Security.
It was not aggression; it was not revenge; it was
not conquest, or even expansion of territories; it
was simply Security.
</p>

<p>
It would be absurd, of course, to imagine that
security is wholly, or even mainly, a question of
military preparations.  "All this is but a sheep
in a lion's skin, where the people are of weak
courage;" or where for any reason, the people are
divided among themselves or disaffected towards
their government.
</p>

<p>
The defences of every nation are of two kinds,
the organised and the unorganised; the disciplined
strength of the Navy and the Army on the one
hand, the vigour and spirit of the people upon the
other.
</p>

<p>
The vigour of the people will depend largely upon
the conditions under which they live, upon sufficiency
of food, the healthiness or otherwise of their
employments and homes, the proper nourishment and
upbringing of their children.  It is not enough that
rates of wages should be good, if those who earn them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
have not the knowledge how to use them to the best
advantage.  It is not always where incomes are
lowest that the conditions of life are worst.  Measured
by infant mortality, and by the health and general
happiness of the community, the crofters of Scotland,
who are very poor, seem to have learned the lesson
<i>how to live</i> better than the highly paid workers in
many of our great manufacturing towns.
</p>

<p>
Education&mdash;by which is meant not merely board-school
instruction, but the influence of the home and
the surrounding society&mdash;is not a less necessary
condition of vigour than wages, sanitary regulations,
and such like.  The spiritual as well as the physical
training of children, the nature of their amusements,
the bent of their interests, the character of their aims
and ideals, at that critical period when the boy or
girl is growing into manhood or womanhood&mdash;all
these are things which conduce directly, as well as
indirectly, to the vigour of the race.  They are every
bit as much a part of our system of national defence
as the manoeuvring of army corps and the gun-practice
of dreadnoughts.
</p>

<p>
The <i>spirit</i> of the people, on the other hand, will
depend for its strength upon their attachment to
their own country; upon their affection for its
customs, laws, and institutions; upon a belief in the
general fairness and justice of its social arrangements;
upon the good relations of the various classes of
which society is composed.  The spirit of national
unity is indispensable even in the case of the most
powerful autocracy.  It is the very foundation of
democracy.  Lacking it, popular government is but
a house of cards, which the first serious challenge
from without, or the first strong outburst of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
discontent from within will bring tumbling to the
ground.  Such a feeling of unity can only spring from
the prevalence of an opinion among every class of
the community, that their own system, with all its
faults, is better suited to their needs, habits, and
traditions than any other, and that it is worth
preserving, even at the cost of the greatest sacrifices,
from foreign conquest and interference.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A TWO-HEADED PRINCIPLE
</span>
</p>

<p>
While a people sapped by starvation and disease
will be wanting in the <i>vigour</i> necessary for offering
a prolonged and strenuous resistance, so will a people,
seething with class hatred and a sense of tyranny
and injustice, be wanting in the <i>spirit</i>.  The problem,
however, of these unorganised defences, fundamental
though it is, stands outside the scope of the present
chapter, which is concerned solely with those defences
which are organised.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The beginning of wisdom with respect to all
problems of defence is the recognition of the
two-headed principle that <i>Policy depends on Armaments
just as certainly as Armaments depend on Policy</i>.
</p>

<p>
The duty of the Admiralty and the War Office
is to keep their armaments abreast of the national
endeavour.  It is folly to do more: it is madness
to do less.  The duty of the Foreign Minister is to
restrain and hold back his policy, and to prevent
it from ambitiously outrunning the capacity of the
armaments which are at his disposal.  If he does
otherwise the end is likely to be humiliation and
disaster.
</p>

<p>
When any nation is unable or unwilling to provide
the armaments necessary for supporting the policy
which it has been accustomed to pursue and would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
like to maintain, it should have the sense to abandon
that policy for something of a humbler sort before
the bluff is discovered by the world.[<a id="chap0303fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
It may possibly appear absurd to dwell with so
much insistence upon a pair of propositions which,
when they are set down in black and white, will at
once be accepted as self-evident by ninety-nine men
out of a hundred.  But plain and obvious as they
are, none in the whole region of politics have been
more frequently ignored.  These two principles have
been constantly presenting themselves to the eyes of
statesmen in a variety of different shapes ever since
history began.
</p>

<p>
It may very easily happen that the particular
policy which the desire for security requires, is
one which the strength of the national armaments
at a given moment will not warrant the country in
pursuing.  Faced with this unpleasant quandary,
what is Government to do, if it be convinced of the
futility of trying to persuade the people to incur the
sacrifices necessary for realising the national
aspirations?  Is it to give up the traditional policy, and
face the various consequences which it is reasonable
to anticipate?  Or is it to persevere in the policy,
and continue acting as if the forces at its disposal
were sufficient for its purpose, when in fact they are
nothing of the kind?  To follow the former course
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
calls for a surrender which the spirit of the people
will not easily endure, and which may even be fatal
to the independent existence of the state.  But to
enter upon the latter is conduct worthy of a fraudulent
bankrupt, since it trades upon an imposture, which,
when it is found out by rival nations, will probably
be visited by still severer penalties.
</p>

<p>
But surely Government has only to make it clear
to the people that, unless they are willing to bring
their armaments abreast of their policy, national
aspirations must be baulked and even national safety
itself may be endangered.  When men are made to
understand these things, will they not certainly agree
to do what is necessary, though they may give their
consent with reluctance?[<a id="chap0303fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is very certain, however, that this outside
view of the case enormously underrates the difficulties
which stare the politician out of countenance.  In
matters of this sort it is not so easy a thing to arrive
at the truth; much less to state it with such force
and clearness that mankind will at once recognise
it for truth, and what is said to the contrary for
falsehood.  The intentions of foreign governments,
and the dangers arising out of that quarter, are
subjects which it is singularly difficult to discuss frankly,
without incurring the very evils which every government
seeks to avoid.  And if these things are not
easy to discuss, it is exceedingly easy for faction or
fanatics to misrepresent them.[<a id="chap0303fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn3">3</a>]  Moreover, the
lamentations of the Hebrew prophets bear witness to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
deafness and blindness of generations into whom
actual experience of the evils foretold had not already
burnt the lesson which it was desired to teach.  Evils
which have never been suffered are hard things to
clothe with reality until it is too late, and words,
even the most eloquent and persuasive, are but a
poor implement for the task.
</p>

<p>
The policy of a nation is determined upon, so as
to accord with what it conceives to be its honour,
safety, and material interests.  In the natural
course of events this policy may check, or be checked
by, the policy of some other nation.  The efforts of
diplomacy may be successful in clearing away these
obstructions.  If so, well and good; but if not,
there is nothing left to decide the issue between the
two nations but the stern arbitrament of war.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, diplomacy itself is dependent upon
armaments in somewhat the same sense as the
prosperity of a merchant is dependent upon his
credit with his bankers.  The news system of the
world has undergone a revolution since the days
before steam and telegraphs.  It is not merely more
rapid, but much ampler.  The various governments
are kept far more fully informed of one another's
affairs, and as a consequence the great issues between
nations have become clear and sharp.  The most
crafty and smooth-tongued ambassador can rarely
wheedle his opponents into concessions which are
contrary to their interests, unless he has something
more to rely upon than his own guile and plausibility.
Army corps and battle fleets looming in the distance
are better persuaders than the subtlest arguments
and the deftest flattery.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is the position of a statesman who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
finds himself confronted by a clash of policies, if,
when the diplomatic deadlock occurs, he realises
that his armaments are insufficient to support his
aim?  In such an event he is faced with the
alternative of letting judgment go by default, or
of adding almost certain military disaster to the
loss of those political stakes for which his nation is
contending with its rival.  Such a position must
be ignominious in the extreme; it might even be
ruinous; and yet it would be the inevitable fate
of any country whose ministers had neglected the
maxim that policy in the last resort is dependent
upon armaments.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
EXAMPLE OF CHINA
</span>
</p>

<p>
If we are in search of an example we shall find it
ready to our hand.  The Empire of China is
comparable to our own at least in numbers; for each
of them contains, as nearly as may be, one quarter
of the whole human race.  And as China has hitherto
failed utterly to make her armaments sufficient, under
the stress of modern conditions, to support even
that meek and passive policy of possession which
she has endeavoured to pursue, so she has been
compelled to watch in helplessness while her policy
has been disregarded by every adventurer.  She has
been pressed by all the nations of the world and
obliged to yield to their demands.  Humiliating
concessions have been wrung from her; favours even
more onerous, in the shape of loans, have been
forced upon her.  The resources with which nature
has endowed her have been exploited by foreigners
against her will.  Her lands have been shorn from
her and parcelled out among those who were strong,
and who hungered after them.  This conquest and
robbery has proceeded both by wholesale and retail.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
Because she yielded this to one claimant, another,
to keep the balance even, has insisted upon that.
Safe and convenient harbours, fortified places, islands,
vast stretches of territory, have been demanded
and taken from her almost without a struggle; and
all this time she has abstained with a timid caution
from anything which can justly be termed
provocation.  For more than half a century, none the
less, China has not been mistress in her own house.
</p>

<p>
The reason of this is plain enough&mdash;China had
possessions which other nations coveted, and she
failed to provide herself with the armaments which
were necessary to maintain them.
</p>

<p>
The British people likewise had possessions which
other nations coveted&mdash;lands to take their settlers,
markets to buy their goods, plantations to yield
them raw materials.  If it were our set
determination to hold what our forefathers won, two
things were necessary: the first, that our policy
should conform to this aim; the second, that our
armaments should be sufficient to support our
policy.
</p>

<p>
A nation which desired to extend its possessions,
to round off its territories, to obtain access to the sea,
would probably regard conquest, or at all events
absorption, as its highest immediate interest.  This
would be the constant aim of its policy, and if its
armaments did not conform to this policy, the aim
would not be realised.  Examples both of failure and
success are to be found in the history of Russia from
the time of Peter the Great, and in that of Prussia
from the days of the Great Elector.
</p>

<p>
A nation&mdash;like England or Holland in the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
was seeking to secure against its commercial rivals,
if necessary by force of arms, new markets among
civilised but unmilitary races, would require a policy
and armaments to correspond.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
BRITISH CONTENTMENT
</span>
</p>

<p>
The British Empire in the stage of development
which it had reached at the end of the Victorian
era did not aim at acquisition of fresh territories
or new markets, save such as might be won peacefully
by the skill and enterprise of its merchants.
It sought only to hold what it already possessed, to
develop its internal resources, and to retain equal
rights with its commercial rivals in neutral spheres.
But in order that those unaggressive objects might
be realised, there was need of a policy, different
indeed from that of Elizabeth, of Cromwell, or of
Chatham, but none the less clear and definite with
regard to its own ends.  And to support this policy
there was need of armaments, suitable in scale and
character.
</p>

<p>
It was frequently pointed out between the years
1901 and 1914 (and it lay at the very root of the
matter), that while we were perfectly satisfied with
things as they stood, and should have been more than
content&mdash;regarding the subject from the standpoint of
our own interests&mdash;to have left the map of the world
for ever, as it then was drawn, another nation was
by no means so well pleased with existing arrangements.
To this envious rival it appeared that we
had taken more than our fair share&mdash;as people are
apt to do who come early.  We had wider territories
than we could yet fill with our own people; while
our neighbour foresaw an early date at which his race
would be overflowing its boundaries.  We had limitless
resources in the Dominions and Dependencies
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
overseas, which when developed would provide a
united empire with markets of inestimable value.
In these respects Germany was in a less favourable
position.  Indeed, with the exceptions of Russia
and the United States, no other great Power was so
fortunately placed as ourselves; and even these
two nations, although they had an advantage over
the British Empire by reason of their huge compact
and coterminous territories, still did not equal it
in the vastness and variety of their undeveloped
resources.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, therefore, the policy which the needs of
our Commonwealth required at this great turning-point
in its history, was not only something different
from that of any other great Power, but also
something different from that which had served our own
purposes in times gone by.  Like China, our aim was
peaceful possession.  Unlike China, we ought to have
kept in mind the conditions under which alone this
aim was likely to be achieved.  It might be irksome
and contrary to our peaceful inclinations to maintain
great armaments when we no longer dreamed of
making conquests; but in the existing state of the
world, armaments were unfortunately quite as
necessary for the purpose of enabling us to hold what we
possessed, as they ever were when our forefathers
set out to win the Empire.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
In 1904, with the object of promoting harmony
between the policy and armaments of the British
Empire, Mr. Balfour created the Committee of
Imperial Defence.  This was undoubtedly a step of
great importance.  His purpose was to introduce
a system, by means of which ministers and high
officials responsible for the Navy and Army would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
be kept in close touch with the trend of national
policy, in so far as it might affect the relations of the
Commonwealth with foreign Powers.  In like manner
those other ministers and high officials, whose
business it was to conduct our diplomacy, maintain an
understanding with the Dominions, administer our
Dependencies, and govern India, would be made
thoroughly conversant with the limitations to our
naval and military strength.  Having this knowledge,
they would not severally embark on irreconcilable
or impracticable projects or drift unknowingly into
dangerous complications.  The conception of the
Committee of Imperial Defence, therefore, was due
to a somewhat tardy recognition of the two-headed
principle, that armaments are mere waste of money
unless they conform to policy, and that policy in
the last resort must depend on armaments.
</p>

<p>
The Committee was maintained by Mr. Balfour's
successors, and was not allowed (as too often happens
when there is a change of government) to fall into
discredit and disuse.[<a id="chap0303fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn4">4</a>]  But in order that this body
of statesmen and experts might achieve the ends in
view, it was essential for them to have realised clearly,
not only the general object of British policy&mdash;which
indeed was contained in the single word 'Security'&mdash;but
also the special dangers which loomed in the
near future.  They had then to consider what
reciprocal obligations had already been contracted with
other nations, whose interests were to some extent
the same as our own, and what further undertakings
of a similar character it might be desirable to enter
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
into.  Finally, there were the consequences which
these obligations and undertakings would entail in
certain contingencies.  It was not enough merely
to mumble the word 'Security' and leave it at that.
What security implied in the then existing state of
the world was a matter which required to be
investigated in a concrete, practical, and business-like
way.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the greater part of these essential
preliminaries was omitted, and as a consequence, the
original idea of the Committee of Imperial Defence
was never realised.  Harmonious, flexible, and of
considerable utility in certain directions, it did not
work satisfactorily as a whole.  The trend of policy
was, no doubt, grasped in a general way; but, as
subsequent events have proved, the conditions on
which alone that line could be maintained, and the
consequences which it involved, were not at any time
clearly understood and boldly faced by this august
body in its corporate capacity.
</p>

<p>
The general direction may have been settled; but
certainly the course was not marked out; the rocks
and shoals remained for the most part uncharted.
The committee, no doubt, had agreed upon a certain
number of vague propositions, as, for example, that
France must not be crushed by Germany, or the
neutrality of Belgium violated by any one.  They
knew that we were committed to certain obligations&mdash;or,
as some people called them, 'entanglements'&mdash;and
that these again, in certain circumstances, might
commit us to others.  But what the whole amounted
to was not realised in barest outline, by the country,
or by Parliament, or by the Government, or even,
we may safely conjecture, by the Committee itself.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
We have the right to say this, because, if British
policy had been realised as a whole by the Committee
of Imperial Defence, it would obviously have been
communicated to the Cabinet, and in its broader
aspects to the people; and this was never done.  It is
inconceivable that any Prime Minister, who believed,
as Mr. Asquith does, in democratic principles, would
have left the country uneducated, and his own
colleagues unenlightened, on a matter of so great
importance, had his own mind been clearly made up.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
CONFUSION WHEN WAR OCCURRED
</span>
</p>

<p>
When the crisis occurred in July 1914, when
Germany proceeded to action, when events took place
which for years past had been foretold and discussed
very fully on both sides of the North Sea, it was as
if a bolt had fallen from the blue.  Uncertainty was
apparent in all quarters.  The very thing which had
been so often talked of had happened.  Germany
was collecting her armies and preparing to crush
France.  The neutrality of Belgium was threatened.
Yet up to, and on, Sunday, August 2, there was
doubt and hesitation in the Cabinet, and until some
days later, also in Parliament and the country.[<a id="chap0303fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
When, finally, it was decided to declare war, the
course of action which that step required still appears
to have remained obscure to our rulers.  Until the
Thursday following it was not decided to send the
Expeditionary Force abroad.  Then, out of timidity,
only two-thirds of it were sent.[<a id="chap0303fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn6">6</a>]  Transport arrangements
which were all ready for moving the whole
force had to be hastily readjusted.  The delay was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
not less injurious than the parsimony; and the
combination of the two nearly proved fatal.
</p>

<p>
If the minds of the people and their leaders were
not prepared for what happened, if in the moral
sense there was unreadiness; still more inadequate
were all preparations of the material kind&mdash;not only
the actual numbers of our Army, but also the whole
system for providing expansion, training, equipment,
and munitions.  It is asking too much of us to
believe that events could have happened as they did
in England during the fortnight which followed the
presentation of the Austrian Ultimatum to Servia,
had the Committee of Imperial Defence and its
distinguished president taken pains beforehand to
envisage clearly the conditions and consequences
involved in their policy of 'Security.'
</p>

<p>
As regards naval preparations, things were better
indeed than might have been expected, considering
the vagueness of ideas in the matter of policy.  We
were safeguarded here by tradition, and the general
idea of direction had been nearly sufficient.  There
was always trouble, but not as a rule serious trouble,
in establishing the case for increases necessary to
keep ahead of German efforts.  There had been
pinchings and parings&mdash;especially in the matter of
fast cruisers, for lack of which, when war broke out,
we suffered heavy losses&mdash;but except in one
instance&mdash;the abandonment of the Cawdor programme&mdash;these
had not touched our security at any vital point.
</p>

<p>
Thanks largely to Mr. Stead, but also to
statesmen of both parties, and to a succession of Naval
Lords who did not hesitate, when occasion required
it, to risk their careers (as faithful servants ever will)
rather than certify safety where they saw danger&mdash;thanks,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
perhaps, most of all to a popular instinct,
deeply implanted in the British mind, which had
grasped the need for supremacy at sea&mdash;our naval
preparations, upon the whole, had kept abreast of
our policy for nearly thirty years.
</p>

<p>
As regards the Army, however, it was entirely
different.  There had been no intelligent effort to
keep our military strength abreast of our policy;
and as, in many instances, it would have been too
bitter a humiliation to keep our policy within the
limits of our military strength, the course actually
pursued can only be described fitly as a game of
bluff.
</p>

<p>
There had never been anything approaching
agreement with regard to the functions which the
Army was expected to perform.  Not only did
political parties differ one from another upon this
primary and fundamental question, but hardly two
succeeding War Ministers had viewed it in the same
light.  There had been schemes of a bewildering
variety; but as the final purpose for which soldiers
existed had never yet been frankly laid down and
accepted, each of these plans in turn had been
discredited by attacks, which called in question the very
basis of the proposed reformation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE NAVAL POSITION
</span>
</p>

<p>
While naval policy had been framed and carried
out in accordance with certain acknowledged necessities
of national existence, military policy had been
alternately expanded and deflated in order to assuage
the anxieties, while conforming to the prejudices&mdash;real
or supposed&mdash;of the British public.  In the case
of the fleet, we had very fortunately arrived, more
than a generation ago, at the point where it was a
question of what the country needed; as regards the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
Army, it was still a question of what the country
would stand.  But how could even a politician know
what the country would stand until the full case had
been laid before the country?  How was it that while
Ministers of both parties had the courage to put the
issue more or less nakedly in the matter of ships,
they grew timid as soon as the discussion turned on
army corps?  If the needs of the Commonwealth
were to be the touchstone in the one case, why not
also in the other?  The country will stand a great
deal more than the politicians think; and it will stand
almost anything better than vacillation, evasion,
and untruth.  In army matters, unfortunately, it
has had experience of little else since the battle of
Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
Mathematicians, metaphysicians, and economists
have a fondness for what is termed 'an assumption.'  They
take for granted something which it would be
inconvenient or impossible to prove, and thereupon
proceed to build upon it a fabric which compels
admiration in a less or greater degree, by reason of
its logical consistency.  There is no great harm in
this method so long as the conclusions, which are
drawn from the airy calculations of the study, are
confined to the peaceful region of their birth; but
so soon as they begin to sally forth into the harsh
world of men and affairs, they are apt to break at
once into shivers.  When the statesman makes an
assumption he does so at his peril; or, perhaps, to
speak more correctly, at the peril of his country.
For if it be a false assumption the facts will
speedily find it out, and disasters will inevitably
ensue.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
TWO INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Our Governments, Tory and Radical alike, have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
acted in recent times as if the British Army were
what their policy required it to be&mdash;something, that
is, entirely different from what it really was.
Judging by its procedure, the Foreign Office would appear
to have made the singularly bold assumption that,
in a military comparison with other nations, Britain
was still in much the same relative position as in the
days of Napoleon.  Sustained by this tenacious but
fantastic tradition, Ministers have not infrequently
engaged in policies which wiser men would have
avoided.  They have uttered protests, warnings,
threats which have gone unheeded.  They have
presumed to say what would and would not be
tolerated in certain spheres; but having nothing
better behind their despatches than a mere assumption
which did not correspond with the facts, they
have been compelled to endure rebuffs and
humiliations.  As they had not the prudence to cut their
coat according to their cloth, it was only natural
that occasionally they should have had to appear
before the world in a somewhat ridiculous guise.
</p>

<p>
British statesmen for nearly half a century had
persisted in acting upon two most dangerous
assumptions.  They had assumed that one branch of the
national armaments conformed to their policy, when
in fact it did not.  And they had assumed also,
which is equally fatal, that policy, if only it be
virtuous and unaggressive, is in some mysterious way
self-supporting, and does not need to depend on
armaments at all.
</p>

<p>
The military preparations of Britain were
inadequate to maintain the policy of Security, which
British Governments had nevertheless been engaged
in pursuing for many years prior to the outbreak of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
the present war.[<a id="chap0303fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn7">7</a>]  On the other hand, the abandonment
of this policy was incompatible with the
continuance of the Empire.  We could not hope to hold
our scattered Dependencies and to keep our Dominions
safe against encroachments unless we were prepared
to incur the necessary sacrifices.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0303fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0303fn1text">1</a>] American writers have urged criticism
of this sort against the armaments
of the U.S.A., which they allege are inadequate
to uphold the policy
of the 'Monroe Doctrine.'  The German view
of the matter has been stated
by the Chancellor (April 7, 1913)
when introducing the Army Bill:&mdash;"History
knows of no people which came to disaster because it had
exhausted itself in the making of its defences;
but history knows of many
peoples which have perished, because,
living in prosperity and luxury,
they neglected their defences.
A people which thinks that it is not rich
enough to maintain its armaments shows
merely that it has played its
part."
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0303fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0303fn2text">2</a>] So the argument runs, and the course
of our naval policy since Mr. Stead's famous press
campaign in 1884 will be cited as an encouragement.

[<a href="#chap0303fn3text">3</a>] <i>E.g.</i> in the winter of 1908 and spring of 1909,

assurances of the German Admiralty,

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
THE BALANCE OF POWER
</h3>

<p>
During the whole period of rather more than
thirteen years&mdash;which has been referred to in previous
pages as the post-Victorian epoch, and which
extended roughly from January 1901, when Queen
Victoria died, to July 1914, when war was declared&mdash;the
British Army remained inadequate for the purpose
of upholding that policy which British statesmen of
both parties, and the British people, both at home
and in the Dominions, were engaged in pursuing&mdash;whether
they knew it or not&mdash;and were bound to
pursue, unless they were prepared to sacrifice their
independence.
</p>

<p>
The aim of that policy was the security of the
whole empire.  This much at any rate was readily
conceded on all hands.  It was not enough, however,
that we approved the general aim of British policy.
A broad but clear conception of the means by which
our Government hoped to maintain this policy, and
the sacrifices which the country would have to make
in order to support this policy, was no less necessary.
So soon, however, as we began to ask for further
particulars, we found ourselves in the region of acute
controversy.  'Security' was a convenient political
formula, which could be accepted as readily by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
man who placed his trust in international law, as by his
neighbour who believed in battle fleets and army corps.
</p>

<p>
In considering this question of security we could
not disregard Europe, for Europe was still the
storm-centre of the world.  We could not afford to turn a
blind eye towards the ambitions and anxieties of
the great continental Powers.  We were bound to
take into account not only their visions but their
nightmares.  We could not remain indifferent to
their groupings and alliances, or to the strength and
dispositions of their armaments.
</p>

<p>
That the United Kingdom was a pair of islands
lying on the western edge of Europe, and that the
rest of the British Empire was remote, and unwilling
to be interested in the rivalries of the Teuton, Slav,
and Latin races, did not affect the matter in the least.
Nowadays no habitable corner of the earth is really
remote; and as for willingness or unwillingness to be
interested, that had nothing at all to do with the
question.  For it was clear that any Power, which
succeeded in possessing itself of the suzerainty of
Europe, could redraw the map of the world at its
pleasure, and blow the Monroe Doctrine, no less
than the British Empire, sky-high.
</p>

<p>
Looking across thousands of leagues of ocean, it
was difficult for the Dominions and the United
States to understand how their fortunes, and the
ultimate fate of their cherished institutions, could
possibly be affected by the turmoil and jealousies
of&mdash;what appeared in their eyes to be&mdash;a number of
reactionary despotisms and chauvinistic democracies.
Even the hundred and twenty leagues which separate
Hull from Emden, or the seven which divide Dover
from Calais, were enough to convince many people
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
in the United Kingdom that we could safely allow
Europe to 'stew in her own juice.'  But unfortunately
for this theory, unless a great continental
struggle ended like the battle of the Kilkenny cats, the
outside world was likely to find itself in an awkward
predicament, when the conqueror chose to speak with
it in the gates, at a time of his own choosing.
</p>

<p>
British policy since 1901 had tended, with ever
increasing self-consciousness, towards the definite aim
of preventing Germany from acquiring the suzerainty
of Western Europe.  It was obvious that German
predominance, if secured, must ultimately force the
other continental nations, either into a German
alliance, or into a neutrality favourable to German
interests.  German policy would then inevitably
be directed towards encroachments upon British
possessions.  Germany had already boldly
proclaimed her ambitions overseas.  Moreover, she
would find it pleasanter to compensate, and soothe
the susceptibilities of those nations whom she had
overcome in diplomacy or war, and to reward their
subsequent services as allies and friendly neutrals,
by paying them out of our property rather than out
of her own.  For this reason, if for no other, we were
deeply concerned that Germany should not dominate
Europe if we could help it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMAN AIMS
</span>
</p>

<p>
During this period, on the other hand, Germany
appeared to be setting herself more and more seriously
to acquire this domination.  Each succeeding year
her writers expressed themselves in terms of greater
candour and confidence.  Her armaments were following
her policy.  The rapid creation of a fleet&mdash;the
counterpart of the greatest army in Europe&mdash;and
the recent additions to the striking power of her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
already enormous army could have no other object.
Certainly from 1909 onwards, it was impossible to
regard German preparations as anything else than a
challenge, direct or indirect, to the security of the
British Empire.
</p>

<p>
Consequently the direction of British policy
returned, gradually, unavowedly, but with certainty,
to its old lines, and became once more concerned with
the maintenance of the <i>Balance of Power</i> as the prime
necessity.  The means adopted were the Triple
Entente between Britain, France, and Russia.  The
object of this understanding was to resist the
anticipated aggressions of the Triple Alliance, wherein
Germany was the predominant partner.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DERELICT MAXIMS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The tendency of phrases, as they grow old, is to
turn into totems, for and against which political
parties, and even great nations, fight unreasoningly.
But before we either yield our allegiance to any of
these venerable formulas, or decide to throw it out
on the scrap-heap, there are advantages in looking to
see whether or not there is some underlying meaning
which may be worth attending to.  It occasionally
happens that circumstances have changed so much
since the original idea was first crystallised in words,
that the old saying contains no value or reality
whatsoever for the present generation.  More often,
however, there is something of permanent importance
behind, if only we can succeed in tearing off the husk
of prejudice in which it has become encased.  So,
according to Disraeli, "the <i>divine right</i> of Kings
may have been a plea for feeble tyrants, but the
divine right of government is the keystone of human
progress."  For many years the phrase <i>British
interests</i>, which used to figure so largely in speeches
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
and leading articles, has dropped out of use, because
it had come to be associated unfavourably with
bond-holders' dividends.  The fact that it also implied
national honour and prestige, the performance of
duties and the burden of responsibilities was
forgotten.  Even the doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i>, which
politicians of all parties have lately agreed to abjure
and contemn, has, as regards industrial affairs, a large
kernel of practical wisdom and sound policy hidden
away in it.  But of all these derelict maxims, that
which until quite recently, appeared to be suffering
from the greatest neglect, was the need for maintaining
the <i>Balance of Power</i> in Europe.  For close on
two generations it had played no overt part in public
controversy, except when some Tory matador produced
it defiantly as a red rag to infuriate the
Radical bull.
</p>

<p>
If this policy of the maintenance of the <i>Balance
of Power</i> has been little heard of since Waterloo, the
reason is that since then, until quite recently, the
<i>Balance of Power</i> has never appeared to be seriously
threatened.[<a id="chap0304fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn1">1</a>]  And because the policy of maintaining
this balance was in abeyance, many people have
come to believe that it was discredited.  Because
it was not visibly and actively in use it was supposed
to have become entirely useless.
</p>

<p>
This policy can never become useless.  It must
inevitably come into play, so soon as any Power
appears to be aiming at the mastery of the continent.
It will ever remain a matter of life or death, to the
United Kingdom and to the British Empire, that
no continental state shall be allowed to obtain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
command, directly or indirectly, of the resources,
diplomacy, and armaments of Europe.
</p>

<p>
In the sixteenth century we fought Philip of
of Spain to prevent him from acquiring European
predominance.  In the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
nineteenth centuries we fought Louis XIV., Louis
XV., and Napoleon for the same reason.  In order to
preserve the balance of power, and with it our own
security, it was our interest under Elizabeth to
prevent the Netherlands from being crushed by Spain.
Under later monarchs it was our interest to prevent
the Netherlands, the lesser German States, Prussia,
Austria, and finally the whole of Europe from being
crushed by France.  And we can as ill afford to-day
to allow France to be crushed by Germany, or Holland
and Belgium to fall into her power.  The wheel has
come round full circle, but the essential British interest
remains constant.
</p>

<p>
The wheel is always turning, sometimes slowly,
sometimes with startling swiftness.  Years hence
the present alliances will probably be discarded.  It
may be that some day the danger of a European
predominance will appear from a different quarter&mdash;from
one of our present allies, or from some upstart
state which may rise to power with an even greater
rapidity than the Electorate of Brandenburg.  Or it
may be that before long the New World, in fact as well
as phrase, may have come in to redress the balance of
the Old.  We cannot say, because we cannot foresee
what the future holds in store.  But from the opening
of the present century, the immediate danger came
from Germany, who hardly troubled to conceal the
fact that she was aiming at predominance by mastery
of the Low Countries and by crushing France.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
CONDITIONS OF BRITISH FREEDOM
</span>
</p>

<p>
That this danger was from time to time regarded
seriously by a section of the British Cabinet, we
know from their own statements both before war
broke out and subsequently.  It was no chimera
confined to the imaginations of irresponsible and
panic-stricken writers.  In sober truth the balance
of power in Europe was in as much danger, and the
maintenance of it had become as supreme a British
interest, under a Liberal government at the beginning
of the twentieth century, as it ever was under
a Whig government at the close of the seventeenth
and opening of the eighteenth.
</p>

<p>
The stealthy return of this doctrine into the region
of practical politics was not due to the prejudices of
the party which happened to be in power.  Quite the
contrary.  Most Liberals distrusted the phrase.  The
whole mass of the Radicals abhorred it.  The idea
which lay under and behind the phrase was nevertheless
irresistible, because it arose out of the facts.
Had a Socialist Government held office, this policy
must equally have imposed itself and been accepted
with a good or ill grace, for the simple reason that,
unless the balance of power is maintained in Europe,
there can be no security for British freedom, under
which we mean, with God's help, to work out our
own problems in our own way.
</p>

<p>
English statesmen had adopted this policy in fact,
if unavowedly&mdash;perhaps even to some extent
unconsciously&mdash;when they first entered into, and
afterwards confirmed, the Triple Entente.  And having
once entered into the Triple Entente it was obvious
that, without risking still graver consequences, we
could never resume the detached position which we
occupied before we took that step.  It is difficult to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
believe&mdash;seeing how the danger of German
predominance threatened France and Russia as well as
ourselves&mdash;that we should not have excited the ill-will
of those two countries had we refused to make
common cause by joining the Triple Entente.  It
was obvious, however, to every one that we could not
afterwards retire from this association without
incurring their hostility.  If we had withdrawn we
should have been left, not merely without a friend in
Europe, but with all the chief Powers in Europe our
enemies&mdash;ready upon the first favourable occasion to
combine against us.
</p>

<p>
There is only one precedent in our history for so
perilous a situation&mdash;when Napoleon forced Europe
into a combination against us in 1806.  And this
precedent, though it then threatened our Empire
with grave dangers, did not threaten it with dangers
comparable in gravity with those which menaced us
a century later.
</p>

<p>
The consequences of breaking away from the
Triple Entente were sufficiently plain.  "We may
build ships against one nation, or even against a
combination of nations.  But we cannot build ships
against half Europe.  If Western Europe, with all
its ports, its harbours, its arsenals, and its resources,
was to fall under the domination of a single will, no
effort of ours would be sufficient to retain the
command of the sea.  It is a balance of power
on the continent, which alone makes it possible
for us to retain it.  Thus the maintenance of the
balance of power is vital to our superiority at sea,
which again is vital to the security of the British
Empire."[<a id="chap0304fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
</p>

<p>
Security in the widest sense was the ultimate
end of our policy&mdash;security of mind, security from
periodic panic, as well as actual military security.
Looked at more closely, the immediate end was
defence&mdash;the defence of the British Empire and of
the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DEFENCE AND INVASION
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the existing condition of the world a policy of
'splendid isolation' was no longer possible.
Conditions with which we are familiar in commercial
affairs, had presented themselves in the political
sphere, and co-operation on a large scale had become
necessary in order to avoid bankruptcy.  England
had entered into the Triple Entente because her
statesmen realised, clearly or vaguely, that by doing
so we should be better able to defend our existence,
and for no other reason.
</p>

<p>
After 1911 it must have been obvious to most
people who considered the matter carefully that in
certain events the Triple Entente would become an
alliance.  It is the interest as well as the duty of
allies to stand by one another from first to last, and
act together in the manner most likely to result in
victory for the alliance.  What then was the manner
of co-operation most likely to result in victory for that
alliance which lay dormant under the Triple Entente?
</p>

<p>
But first of all, to clear away one obscurity&mdash;<i>Invasion</i>
was not our problem; <i>Defence</i> was our
problem; for the greater included the less.
</p>

<p>
The word 'defence' is apt to carry different
meanings to different minds.  The best defence of
England and British interests, at any given time,
may or may not consist in keeping our main army
in the United Kingdom and waiting to be attacked
here.  It all depends upon the special circumstances
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
of each case.  The final decision must be governed
by one consideration, and one only&mdash;how to strike
the speediest, heaviest, and most disabling blow at
the aggressor.  If by keeping our army in England
and endeavouring to lure the enemy into our toils,
that end is most likely to be accomplished, then it is
obviously best to keep our army here.  If by sending
it into the north of France to combine with the
French the supreme military object has a superior
chance of being achieved, then it is best to send it
into the north of France.
</p>

<p>
A defensive war cannot be defined and circumscribed
as a war to drive out invaders, or even to
prevent the landing of invaders.  The best way to
defend your castle may be to man the walls, to fall
upon the enemy at the ford, to harry his lands, or
even to attack him in his castle.  There is no fixed
rule.  The circumstances in each case make the rule.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
CO-OPERATION WITH FRANCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
A war is not less a defensive war if you strike at
your enemy in his own territory, or if you come to
the aid of your ally, whose territory has been invaded
or is threatened.  In the circumstances which
prevailed for a considerable number of years prior to
the outbreak of the present war, it gradually became
more and more obvious, that our soundest defence
would be joint action with France upon her
north-eastern frontier.  For there, beyond any doubt,
would Germany's supreme effort be made against
the Triple Entente.  If the attack failed at that
point, it would be the heaviest and most disabling
blow which our enemy could suffer.  If, on the other
hand, it succeeded, France and England would have
to continue the struggle on terms immensely less
favourable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
</p>

<p>
This opinion was not by any means unanimously
or clearly held; but during the summer of 1911 and
subsequently, it was undoubtedly the hypothesis
upon which those members of our Government relied,
who were chiefly responsible for the conduct of
foreign affairs.  Unfortunately Parliament and the
country had never accepted either the policy or its
consequences; they had never been asked to accept
either the one or the other; nor had they been
educated with a view to their acceptance.
</p>

<p>
At that time the error was exceedingly prevalent,
that it is a more comfortable business fighting in
your own country than in somebody else's.  From
this it followed that it would be folly to engage in
what were termed disapprovingly 'foreign adventures,'
and that we should be wise to await attack
behind our own shores.  Recent events have wrought
such a complete and rapid conversion from this
heresy, that it is no longer worth while wasting words
in exposing it.  It is necessary, however, to recall
how influential this view of the matter was, not only
up to the declaration of war, but even for some time
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
As to the precise form of co-operation between
the members of the Triple Entente in case of war,
there could be no great mystery.  It was obvious to
any one who paid attention to what happened during
the summer and autumn of 1911, that in the event of
Germany attacking France over the Agadir dispute,
we had let it be understood and expected, that we
should send our Expeditionary Force across the
Channel to co-operate with the French army on the
north-eastern frontier.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0304fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0304fn1text">1</a>] It can hardly be overlooked, however,
that this principle, rightly or
wrongly interpreted, had something
to do with the Crimean War (1854-56)
and with the British attitude at the
Congress of Berlin (1878).

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
THE MILITARY SITUATION
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(August 1911)
</p>

<p>
The full gravity of the Agadir incident, though
apparent to other nations, was never realised by the
people of this country.  The crisis arose suddenly in
July 1911.  Six weeks later it had subsided; but it
was not until well on in the autumn that its meanings
were grasped, even by that comparatively small
section of the public who interest themselves in
problems of defence and foreign affairs.  From
October onwards, however, an increasing number
began to awake to the fact, that war had only been
avoided by inches, and to consider seriously&mdash;many
of them for the first time in their lives&mdash;what would
have happened if England had become involved in
a European conflict.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
From various official statements, and from
discussions which from time to time had taken place in
Parliament, it was understood that our 'Expeditionary
Force' consisted of six infantry divisions, a cavalry
division, and army troops;[<a id="chap0305fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn1">1</a>] also that the national
resources permitted of this force being kept up to
full strength for a period of at least six months, after
making all reasonable deductions for the wastage of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
war.  Was this enough?  Enough for what? ... To
uphold British policy; to preserve Imperial
security; to enable the Triple Entente to maintain
the balance of power in Europe.  These were vague
phrases; what did they actually amount to? ... The
adequacy or inadequacy of such an army as this
for doing what was required of it&mdash;for securing speedy
victory in event of war&mdash;or still better for preserving
peace by the menace which it opposed to German
schemes of aggression&mdash;can only be tested by
considering the broad facts with regard to numbers,
efficiency, and readiness of all the armies which would
be engaged directly, or indirectly, in a European
struggle.
</p>

<p>
War, however, had been avoided in 1911, and not
a few people were therefore convinced that the
menace of the available British army, together with
the other consequences to be apprehended from the
participation of this country, had been sufficient to
deter Germany from pursuing her schemes of aggression,
if indeed she had actually harboured any notions
of the kind.  But others, not altogether satisfied
with this explanation and conclusion, were inclined
to press their enquiries somewhat further.
Supposing war had actually been declared, would the
British force have been sufficient&mdash;acting in
conjunction with the French army&mdash;to repel a German
invasion of France and Belgium, to hurl back the
aggressors and overwhelm them in defeat?  Would
it have been sufficient to accomplish the more modest
aim of holding the enemy at his own frontiers, or
even&mdash;supposing that by a swift surprise he had been
able to overrun Belgium&mdash;at any rate to keep him
out of France?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
</p>

<p>
When people proceeded to seek for answers to
these questions, as many did during the year 1912,
they speedily discovered that, in considerations of
this sort, the governing factor is numbers&mdash;the
numbers of the opposing forces available at the
outbreak of war and in the period immediately
following.  The tremendous power of national spirit
must needs be left out of such calculations as a thing
immeasurable, imponderable, and uncertain.  It was
also unsafe to assume that the courage, intelligence,
efficiency, armament, transport, equipment, supplies,
and leadership of the German and Austrian armies
would be in any degree inferior to those of the Triple
Entente.  Certain things had to be allowed for in a
rough and ready way;[<a id="chap0305fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn2">2</a>] but the main enquiry was
forced to concern itself with numerical strength.
</p>

<p>
There was not room for much disagreement upon
the broad facts of the military situation, among
soldiers and civilians who, from 1911 onwards, gave
themselves to the study of this subject at the available
sources of information; and their estimates have
been confirmed, in the main, by what has happened
since war began.  The Intelligence departments of
London, Paris, and Petrograd&mdash;with much ampler
means of knowledge at their disposal&mdash;can have
arrived at no other conclusions.  What the English
War Office knew, the Committee of Imperial Defence
likewise knew; and the leading members of the
Cabinet, if not the whole Government, must be
presumed to have been equally well informed.
</p>

<p>
It was assumed in these calculations, that in case
of tension between the Triple Entente and the Triple
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
Alliance, the latter would not be able&mdash;in the first
instance at all events&mdash;to bring its full strength into
the struggle.  For unless Germany and Austria
managed their diplomacy before the outbreak of
hostilities with incomparable skill, it seemed
improbable that the Italian people would consent to
engage in a costly, and perhaps ruinous, war&mdash;a
war against France, with whom they had no quarrel;
against England, towards whom they had long
cherished feelings of friendship; on behalf of the
Habsburg Empire, which they still regarded&mdash;and
not altogether unreasonably&mdash;with suspicion and
enmity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NEUTRALITY OF ITALY
</span>
</p>

<p>
But although the neutrality of Italy might be
regarded as a likelihood at the opening of the war,
it could not be reckoned on with any certainty as a
permanent condition.  For as no one can forecast
the course of a campaign, so no one can feel secure
that the unexpected may not happen at any moment.
The consequences of a defeat in this quarter or in
that, may offer too great temptations to the cupidity
of onlookers; while diplomacy, though it may have
bungled in the beginning, is sure to have many
opportunities of recovering its influence as the
situation develops.  Consequently, unless and until Italy
actually joined in the struggle on the side of the
Triple Entente, a considerable section of the French
army would, in common prudence, have to be left
on guard upon the Savoy frontier.
</p>

<p>
In a war brought on by the aggressive designs of
Germany, the only nations whose participation could
be reckoned on with certainty&mdash;and this only
supposing that Britain stood firmly by the policy upon
which her Government had embarked&mdash;were Russia,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
France, and ourselves on the one side, Germany and
Austria-Hungary on the other.
</p>

<p>
It would certainly be necessary for Germany, as
well as Austria, to provide troops for coast defences,
and also for the frontiers of neutral countries, which
might have the temptation, in certain circumstances, to
deneutralise themselves at an inconvenient moment,
if they were left unwatched.  On the north and
west were Denmark, Holland, and Belgium, each
of which had a small field army, besides garrison
and fortress troops which might be turned to more
active account upon an emergency.  On the south
and east were Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania,
whose military resources were on a considerable scale,
and whose neutrality was not a thing altogether to
be counted on, even before the Balkan war[<a id="chap0305fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn3">3</a>] had
lowered the prestige of Turkey.  In addition there
was Italy, who although a pledged ally in a defensive
war was not likely, for that reason, to consider
herself bound to neutrality, benevolent or otherwise,
if in her judgment, the particular contingencies
which called for her support had not arisen at the
outset.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
SUPERIORITY OF GERMAN NUMBERS
</span>
</p>

<p>
After taking such precautions as seemed prudent
under these heads, Germany would then be obliged
to detach for service, in co-operation with the
Austrians in Poland, and along the whole eastern
border, a sufficient number of army corps to secure
substantial superiority over the maximum forces
which Russia, hampered by an inadequate railway
system and various military considerations,[<a id="chap0305fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn4">4</a>] could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
be expected to bring into the field and maintain
there during the first few months of the war.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was reckoned[<a id="chap0305fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn5">5</a>] after taking all these things into
account, that Germany would have available, for the
invasion of France, an army consisting of some ninety
divisions&mdash;roughly, rather more than a million and
three-quarters of men&mdash;and that she could maintain
this force at its full strength&mdash;repairing the wastage of
war out of her ample reserves&mdash;for a period of at least
six months.  It was assumed that the Kaiser, relying
upon the much slower mobilisation of Russia, would
undoubtedly decide to use the whole of this huge
force in the west, in the hope that before pressure
could begin to make itself felt in the east, France
would either have been crushed, as she was in 1870,
or so much mangled that it would be possible to send
reinforcements of an overwhelming character to
make victory secure in Poland.
</p>

<p>
Against this German force of 1,800,000, France,
according to the best information available, could
put into the field and maintain at full strength for
a similar period of six months about 1,300,000 men.
But this was the utmost that could be expected of
the French, and the initial discrepancy of 500,000
men was very serious.  It precluded all reasonable
hope on their part of being able to take the offensive,
to which form of warfare the genius of the people
was most adapted.  It would compel them to remain
on the defensive, for which it was believed at that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
time&mdash;though wrongly, as events have proved&mdash;that
they were ill suited by temperament as well as
tradition.
</p>

<p>
If England joined in the war by land as well as
sea the numerical deficiency would be reduced to
340,000 on the arrival of our Expeditionary Force.
In this connection, as well as for other reasons, the
attitude of Holland and Belgium, and that of
Germany with respect to these two countries, were
clearly matters of high importance.
</p>

<p>
Holland had a field army of four divisions, and
her interests could be summed up in the words,
'preservation of independence.'  She would naturally
wish to avoid being actively embroiled in the war on
one side or the other; and, fortunately for her, she
had every reason to believe that her neutrality would
not be disturbed or questioned.  Her territories lay
to one side of the probable campaign area, and
moreover, whatever might be the ulterior designs
of Germany with regard to western expansion, it was
obvious that her immediate interests must necessarily
lie in Dutch neutrality, which would be infinitely
more useful to her than a Dutch alliance.  For
Holland holds the mouths of the Scheldt and Rhine,
and so long as she remained neutral, it was anticipated
that imports and exports would readily find their
way into and out of Germany.  This advantage
would cease were Britain to establish a blockade of
these inlets, as she would certainly do if they belonged
to a hostile Power.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
POSITION OF BELGIUM
</span>
</p>

<p>
In certain respects Belgium was in the same case
as Holland.  She likewise had a field army of four
divisions, and her interests could be summed up in
the words, 'preservation of independence.'  But
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
here all resemblance between the two countries
ended.
</p>

<p>
Belgium was not merely the southern portion
(Holland being the northern) of that Naboth's
vineyard, the possession of which German visionaries had
proclaimed to be essential to Teutonic world-power.
Belgium was more even than this.  If the permanent
possession of Belgian territory was a political object
in the future, temporary occupation was no less a
military necessity of the present.  For in order
that Germany might benefit in full measure by her
numerical superiority, Belgian roads and railways
were required, along which to transport her troops,
and Belgian hills and plains on which to deploy
them.  If Germany were confined to the use of her
own frontiers she would not only lose in swiftness of
attack, but her legions would be piled up, one behind
another, like a crowd coming out of a theatre.  She
needed space on which to spread out her superior
numbers in order that her superior numbers might
make certain of victory.
</p>

<p>
There was an idea at this time (1911-12) that
Germany would be satisfied to keep to the south-east
of the fortified line of the Meuse&mdash;moving through
Luxemburg and the mountains of the Ardennes&mdash;and
that if Belgium saw fit to yield, under protest, to
<i>force majeure</i>, the northern region, containing the
great plain of Flanders and all cities of importance,
would be left inviolate.  This theory was probably
erroneous, for the reason that&mdash;as the event has
shown&mdash;Germany required a greater space and more
favourable ground, than would have been provided
under this arrangement, in order to bring her great
superiority to bear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
</p>

<p>
With the French on the other hand there was no
similar advantage to be gained by the violation of
Belgian neutrality.  From their point of view the
shorter the battle front could be kept the better.
If Belgium chose to range herself by the side of France
as a willing ally it would undoubtedly be a great
gain; but if she chose to remain neutral the French
could have no object in invading or occupying her
territories.
</p>

<p>
It was assumed, and no doubt rightly, that, like
Holland, Belgium would prefer to remain neutral&mdash;leaving
the question of future absorption to take care
of itself&mdash;provided she could do this without enduring
the humiliation of allowing foreign armies to violate
her soil.  For she knew that, in the event of a French
victory, her independence would remain assured;
whereas, if the Germans were successful, she would
have avoided awakening their hostility and giving
them an excuse for annexation.  But even if Belgium,
under gross provocation, were forced to take sides
against Germany, the deficit in numbers on the side
of the Triple Entente would only be reduced by some
eighty or a hundred thousand men.  The deficit
would still stand, roughly, at a quarter of a million
men.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
INADEQUACY OF BRITISH ARMY
</span>
</p>

<p>
In view of the foregoing considerations it was
clearly absurd to think that our own small force was
at all adequate, in a military sense, to deter Germany
from engaging in a war of aggression.  Had we been
able, during the years 1912 to 1914, to see into the
minds of the German General Staff we should
probably have realised that this inadequacy was even
greater than it appeared.  We should then have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
known that the numbers of the Kaiser's striking
force had been carefully understated; and that the
amount of preparations in the way of material had
been hidden away with an equal industry.  We
should also have learned, that the sending of our
army abroad was viewed with scepticism in German
military circles, as an event hardly likely to occur.
But even if our Expeditionary Force did go, it was
altogether inadequate to redress the adverse balance;
still more inadequate to bring an immediate victory
within the range of practical possibility.  It was
inadequate to hold back the premeditated invasion,
either at the German frontier, or even at the French
frontier.  It was inadequate to make Belgian resistance
effective, even if that nation should determine
to throw in its lot with the Triple Entente.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of the very simplest arithmetic our
land forces were inadequate for any of these purposes.
They were unequal to the task of maintaining the
balance of power by giving a numerical superiority
to the armies of the Triple Entente.  Our armaments
therefore did not correspond with our policy.  It
was clear that they would not be able to uphold that
policy if it were put to the supreme test of war.  It
was impossible to abandon our policy.  It was not
impossible, and it was not even in 1912 too late,
to have set about strengthening our armaments.
Nothing of the kind, however, was undertaken by the
Government, whose spokesmen, official and unofficial,
employed themselves more congenially in deriding
and rebuking Lord Roberts for calling attention to the
danger.
</p>

<p>
Of course if it had been possible to place reliance
upon the statement of the English War Minister,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
made little more than a year before war broke out,[<a id="chap0305fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn6">6</a>]
that every soldier under the voluntary system is
worth ten conscripts, we and our Allies would have
been in a position of complete security.  In that case
our force of 160,000 would have been the equivalent
of 1,600,000 Germans, and we should from the first
have been in a superiority of more than a million
over our enemies.
</p>

<p>
Even if we could have credited the more modest
assumption of the Attorney-General&mdash;made nearly
four months after war broke out&mdash;that one volunteer
was worth three 'pressed' men, the opposing forces
would have been somewhere about an equality.[<a id="chap0305fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately both these methods of ready-reckoning
were at fault, except for their immediate purpose
of soothing, or deluding the particular audiences to
which they were addressed.  The words were meaningless
and absurd in a military sense; though conceivably
they possessed some occult political virtue, and
might help, for a time at least, to avert the retribution
which is due to unfaithful stewards.
</p>

<p>
Both these distinguished statesmen, as well as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
many of their colleagues and followers, were beset
by the error of false opposites.  A soldier who has
enlisted voluntarily, and another who is a conscript
or 'pressed' man, have equally to fight their country's
enemies when they are ordered to do so.  In both
cases the particular war may be against their
consciences and judgments; and their participation in it
may therefore be involuntary.
</p>

<p>
Of two men&mdash;equal in age, strength, training, and
courage&mdash;one of whom believes his cause to be just,
while the other does not, there can be no doubt that
the former will fight better than the latter&mdash;even though
the latter was enlisted under the voluntary system
while the former was a conscript or 'pressed' man.  In
this sense the superiority of the 'voluntary' principle
is incontestable.  But is there any evidence to show,
that either the original soldiers, or the new levies, of the
German army are risking their lives in this war any
less willingly than our own countrymen, who went out
with the Expeditionary Force, or those others who
have since responded to Lord Kitchener's appeal?  Is
there any reason to suppose that they are fighting
any less bravely and intelligently?[<a id="chap0305fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Another matter of importance in these calculations
with regard to the military strength of the
Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance was the time
limit.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE THREE PERIODS OF WAR
</span>
</p>

<p>
There are three periods in war.  There is the
<i>onset</i> of war, where swiftness of action is what tells
most; there is the <i>grip</i> of war, where numbers of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
trained men are what tell most; and there is the
<i>drag</i> of war, when what tells most is the purse.
</p>

<p>
Speaking by the book, it is of course numbers
which tell all the way through.  At the beginning&mdash;in
the <i>onset</i>&mdash;the aim is to hurl superior numbers
at a vital point&mdash;taking the enemy by surprise,
and thereby disordering his whole plan of campaign&mdash;very
much as you knock a limpet off a rock, with
a sharp unexpected blow.
</p>

<p>
If this effort fails to settle matters, then we are
in the <i>grip</i>.  Here it is a case of sheer heavy slogging
of all the available trained troops.  The weaker side
is driven to the defensive.  It is found making use of
every artificial and natural advantage to counteract
the superiority which threatens it, and which must
speedily prevail, if only it be superior enough.
</p>

<p>
Finally, after a longer or shorter period of
indecisive deadlock, the time comes when trained
troops and material of war accumulated in advance
begin to run short&mdash;when new levies, raised since
the war broke out, begin to take the field, well or ill
equipped, well or ill armed, as the case may be.
When this stage is reached we are in the <i>drag</i> of
war; and the side which can best afford to feed,
clothe, and arm its fresh reinforcements stands at
an enormous advantage.
</p>

<p>
In 1870 war was announced on July 15th, and
formally declared on the 19th.  Three weeks later,
on August 6th, the important battles of Woerth and
Spicheren were won by the Germans.  On September
2nd, the issue of the war was decided, when the
Emperor of the French, with his main army,
surrendered at Sedan.  Metz fell in the last days of
October, and Paris on the first day of March in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
following year.  In that war the <i>onset</i> settled
everything.  There was no real <i>grip</i> of the opposing
forces.  The German attack had been so swift,
vigorous, and successful that France was knocked
out in the first round.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
RESULTS OF SUCCESS IN ONSET
</span>
</p>

<p>
The speed with which great armies can be mobilised
and hurled against one another has not diminished
in the forty odd years which have elapsed since the
<i>dbcle</i>.  On the contrary, the art of war has been
largely concerned in the interval with the vital
question, how to get in the first deadly blow.
</p>

<p>
The military view was, that probably not earlier
than the fifteenth day&mdash;certainly not later than the
twenty-first&mdash;a battle would take place which must
be of the highest importance, and which might quite
well be decisive.  It might make ultimate German
victory only a matter of time; or it might only
determine whether the ensuing campaign was to be
waged on French or German soil&mdash;whether there
was to be a German invasion of France or a Franco-British
invasion of Germany.  Consequently, if our
Expeditionary Force was to render assistance at the
critical time, it must reach its position on the frontier
within a fortnight of the outbreak of war.
</p>

<p>
As to the <i>drag</i> of war, the Triple Entente had the
advantage, if that stage were ever reached.  For the
purses of England, France, and Russia were much
longer than those of Germany and Austria.  It was
important, however, to remember that there would
be no hope for us in the <i>drag</i> of war, if Germany
could deliver a heavy enough blow at the beginning,
as she did in 1870.
</p>

<p>
These were the considerations as to time, which
presented themselves to students of the military
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
situation during the breathing space which followed
upon the Agadir crisis.  The substantial accuracy of
this forecast was confirmed by what happened during
August and September of last year.  In 1914 war
was declared by Germany on August 1st.  For several
days before she had been engaged actively in mobilisation.
Three weeks later three important battles&mdash;on
the road to Metz, at Charleroi, and at Mons[<a id="chap0305fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn9">9</a>]&mdash;were
won by the Germans.  If it had not been for the
unexpected obstacle of Lige the last two engagements
would in all probability have been fought at an even
earlier date, and in circumstances much more
unfavourable to the Franco-British forces.  But in the
early days of September, instead of the crushing
defeat of Sedan, there was the victory of the Marne,
and the Germans were forced to retreat to entrenched
positions north of the Aisne.[<a id="chap0305fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
The <i>onset</i> period was ended; but the issue had
not been settled as in 1870.  France and England had
not been knocked out in the first round.  To this
extent the supreme German endeavour had miscarried.
Nevertheless a great advantage had been secured by
our enemies, inasmuch as it was now apparent that
the ensuing campaign&mdash;the <i>grip</i> of war&mdash;would be
contested, not on German soil, but in France and Belgium.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LIMITATIONS OF SEA POWER
</span>
</p>

<p>
The value of the assistance which the British
Navy would be able to render to the cause of the
Triple Entente was a consideration of the highest
importance.  But while the fleet, if the national
confidence in it were justified, would render invaluable
assistance to military operations, it was necessary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
to bear in mind&mdash;what Englishmen in recent times
have been very apt to forget&mdash;that no success at sea,
whether it consisted in the wholesale destruction of
hostile ships, or in an absolute blockade of the enemy's
coast, could by itself determine the main issue of a
European contest of this character.  Disaster in a
land battle could not be compensated for, nor could
the balance of power be maintained, by any naval
victory.  War would not be brought to an end
favourable to the Triple Entente, even by a victory
as complete as that of Trafalgar.  It is also well to
remember that peace came, not after Trafalgar, but
after Waterloo, nearly ten years later.
</p>

<p>
The strange idea that the security of the British
Empire can be maintained by the Navy alone, seems
to be derived by a false process of reasoning, from
the undeniable truth, that the supremacy of our
Navy is essential to our security.  But though it is
essential&mdash;and the first essential&mdash;it is not the only
essential of security.
</p>

<p>
An insular Power, largely dependent on sea-borne
food supplies and raw materials for its industries&mdash;a
Power which governs an empire in the East, which
has dependencies scattered in every sea, which is
politically united with immense but sparsely peopled
dominions in the four quarters of the globe&mdash;must
keep command of the sea.  If that supremacy were
once lost the British Empire, as an empire, would come
to an end.  Its early dissolution would be inevitable.
Therefore it is true enough to say that if the German
Alliance&mdash;or any other alliance&mdash;were to win a
decisive naval victory against Britain, it would end the
war completely and effectively so far as we were
concerned.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
</p>

<p>
But the converse is not the case, and for obvious
reasons.  In a contest with a continental enemy
who conquers on land, while we win victory after
victory at sea, the result will not be a settlement in
our favour, but a drawn issue.  And the draw will
be to his advantage, not our own.  For having
overthrown the balance of power by reason of his
successful campaign and invasions, he will then be
free to concentrate his whole energies upon wresting
away naval supremacy from the British Empire.  In
time the Sea Power which is only a Sea Power will be
overborne with numbers, and finally worsted by the
victorious Land Power.  For how is it possible to
fight with one hand against an enemy with two
hands?  The fleets of Europe which at last must be
combined against us, if we allow any rival to obtain
a European predominance, are too heavy odds.
German preparations alone were already causing
us grave anxiety nearly three years before the Agadir
crisis occurred.  How then could we hope to build
against the whole of Europe?  Or even against
half of Europe, if the other half remained coldly
neutral?

[<a href="#chap0305fn7text">7</a>] Sir John Simon (Attorney-General

November 21, 1914....  This speech is instructive reading.
It is also comforting for the assurance it contains,

seeing that war was a thing which,

not wholly convinced and reassured.
There is a touch of over-emphasis&mdash;as
if perhaps, after all, the orator needed
the support of his own vehemence to
keep him reminded of the righteousness.
The pacifist in war-paint is apt
to overact the unfamiliar part.
One wonders from what sort of British
officer at the front the Attorney-General
had derived the impression that
'one' of our own voluntary soldiers&mdash;gallant
fellows though they are&mdash;is
the equal of 'three' of the Germans who face him,
or of the Frenchmen who
fight by his side....
This speech puts us not a little in mind of <i>Evangelist's</i>
warning to <i>Christian</i>, with regard to <i>Mr. Legality's</i>
fluent promises to relieve
him of his burden&mdash;"There is nothing
in all this noise save a design to
beguile thee of thy salvation."

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
THE MILITARY SITUATION
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(August 1914)
</p>

<p>
Such was the position of affairs at July 1911,
as it appeared to the eyes of people who&mdash;during the
ensuing period&mdash;endeavoured to arrive at an
understanding of the problem without regard to the
exigencies of party politics.  Between that date
and July 1914, when war broke out, various changes
took place in the situation.  The general effect of
these changes was adverse to Britain and her allies.
</p>

<p>
In 1911 the German estimates provided for
considerable increases, especially in artillery and
machine-guns.  The peace strength of the Army
was raised.
</p>

<p>
In the following year, 1912, further additions
were made to the peace strength, and two new
army corps were formed out of existing units&mdash;one
for the Polish, the other for the French frontier.
Artillery and machine-guns were very greatly
increased in the ordinary estimates of that year, and
again in those of 1913.  In addition, Germany at
the same time added a squadron to her fleet in
the North Sea, by arranging to keep more ships
permanently in commission.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P270"></a>270}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MILITARY INCREASES
</span>
</p>

<p>
But early in 1913 it became known, that the
German Government was about to introduce an
Army Bill, providing for immense and sensational
additions.  The sum of 50,000,000 was to be raised
by loan for initial expenditure.  The increased
cost of upkeep on the proposed new establishment
would amount to 9,500,000 per annum.  Sixty-three
thousand more recruits were to be taken each year.
The total peace strength of the Army was to be raised
by approximately 200,000 men.  Nearly four millions
sterling was to be spent on aircraft, and ten and a
half on fortifications; while the war-chest was to be
raised from six to eighteen millions.  Twenty-seven
thousand additional horses were to be purchased.
</p>

<p>
These proposals were timed to take effect the same
autumn; so that by the following Midsummer (1914),
the military strength of Germany would have reaped
the main benefit which was anticipated from the
enormous additions.
</p>

<p>
It was not in the power of France to increase the
actual total of her numbers, because for many years
past she had already taken every man who was
physically fit for military service.  About eighty
per cent of the young Frenchmen who came each
year before the revision boards had been enlisted;
whereas in Germany&mdash;up to the passing of the new
Army Law&mdash;considerably less than fifty per cent had
been required to serve.  The German Army as a
consequence was composed of picked men, while
the French Army contained a considerable proportion
who were inferior both in character and physique.
</p>

<p>
But in the face of the new German menace France
had to do the best she could.  She had to do it
alone, for the reason that the British Government
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
entertained conscientious and insuperable objections
to bearing its due share of the burden.
</p>

<p>
Already, prior to the sensational expansion of
Germany in 1913, France had endeavoured to counteract
the current yearly increases in the military estimates
of her neighbour, by various reorganisations and
regroupings of active units, and by improvements
calculated to improve the efficiency of the reserves.  But
when information was forthcoming[<a id="chap0306fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0306fn1">1</a>] as to the nature
and extent of the developments proposed under the
German Army Bill of 1913, it was at once realised
that more drastic measures were essential to national
safety.
</p>

<p>
Before the German projects were officially
announced, the French Government took the bold step
of asking the legislature to sanction a lengthening of
the period of active military service from two years to
three, and an extension of the age limit of the reserves
from forty-seven to forty-nine.  Power was also taken
to summon, in case of emergency, the annual
contingent of recruits a year before their due time.
Increases in artillery, engineers, railways, barrack
accommodation, and subsidiary services were asked
for and obtained.  The cost of these, when the whole
sum came to be calculated, was found to amount to
32,000,000.
</p>

<p>
Apart, therefore, from material preparations of
one kind and another, Germany was taking steps to
add 200,000 men to her striking force, and the
intentions of France were approximately the same.  In the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
case of Germany, however, the increases of strength
would be operative by Midsummer 1914, while with
France they would not take effect until two years later.[<a id="chap0306fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0306fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
Germany, moreover, was arranging to take 63,000
more recruits annually.  France was unable to obtain
any more recruits, as she already took all that were
fit to bear arms.  The increase in her striking force
was made mainly at the expense of her reserves.
Year by year, therefore, the numerical inferiority of
France must become more marked.
</p>

<p>
Russia meanwhile was proceeding with her
programme of military extension and reorganisation
which had been decided on after the Japanese war.
A great part of her expenditure was being devoted
to the improvement of her exceedingly defective
system of railways and communications, and to the
fortification of the Gulf of Finland.
</p>

<p>
Austria did not remain stationary in military
preparations any more than her neighbours.  Her
intake of recruits was 181,000 in 1912.  It was
decided to raise it to 206,000 in 1913, and again to
216,000 in 1914.
</p>

<p>
In the British Army, during this critical period,
there had of course been no increases, but the reverse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Regular Forces, which had been, reduced in
1906 by nine battalions,[<a id="chap0306fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0306fn3">3</a>] were in 1914 some eight
thousand men under their nominal strength.  The
Territorials, which had never yet reached the figure
postulated by their originator, were at this date
about 47,000 short.  The Army Reserve was doomed
in the near future to an automatic shrinkage on a
considerable scale, owing to the reductions which had
been effected in the Regular Forces, from which the
reservists were drawn at the expiry of their terms
of service.
</p>

<p>
Actually, therefore, the weakness of our own
military position had become more marked since
1911.  Relatively it had undergone an even greater
change for the worse, owing to the stupendous
German programme, to the fact that we had lagged
behind in the matter of aircraft, and that our naval
preponderance was not so great as it had been three
years earlier.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
EFFECT OF BALKAN WARS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The events which occurred in the Turkish peninsula
between October 1912, when the first Balkan war
broke out, and August 1913, when the second was
ended by the Treaty of Bucharest, were not without
their bearing upon the general balance of power in
Europe.  Turkey had collapsed before the onset of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
the allied states of Montenegro, Servia, Bulgaria,
and Greece, and this was a serious injury to German
interests.  The Ottoman Empire had been warmly
suitored, over a long period of years, by the diplomacy
of Berlin, with a view to co-operation in certain
contingencies.  On the other hand, the result of the
second war&mdash;fomented by the intrigues of Vienna&mdash;in
which Bulgaria was finally overpowered by the other
three states, destroyed for the time being Slav
solidarity, and thereby considerably relieved the
apprehensions of Austria with regard to her southern
frontier and recently annexed provinces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina....  Profit-and-loss accounts of
this sort are impossible to work out upon an
arithmetical basis, and perhaps the chief importance of
such occurrences as these lies in the effect which they
produce upon the nerves of the onlookers.  On the
whole&mdash;judging by the tone of diplomacy at the time&mdash;the
Balkan series of events appeared to have raised
greater anxieties in the Chancelleries of Germany and
Austria than in any other quarter; though why this
should have been so, it is difficult to understand.
</p>

<p>
Looking back at the Balkan struggle in the light
of subsequent events, it appears to us now a great
deal less remarkable for what it actually produced
than for what it failed to produce.  It failed to set
Europe in a blaze, and yet it afforded far better
opportunities for doing this than the Serajevo
murders in June 1914.
</p>

<p>
The full inner history of the negotiations between
the Great Powers, for six months prior to the Treaty
of Bucharest, will be interesting reading, if it ever
sees the light.  If even one of them had chosen to
work for war during this period, nothing could have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P275"></a>275}</span>
kept the peace.  If one or two of them had been
apathetic, war must inevitably have come of itself.
But even France&mdash;who at that time was showing
signs of superficial excitement, and on that account
was credited, not only in the German press, but in
a section of our own, with chauvinistic designs&mdash;worked
hard for peace.  It is certain that Germany
desired peace; many well-informed people indeed
believed that at this time she desired peace more
ardently than any other state.  It is true that a few
days before the Treaty of Bucharest was signed,
Italy had been secretly sounded by Austria as to
whether she would join with her two allies in making
an attack on Servia; but the Italian reply being of a
kind that took away all hope of securing the military
assistance of that country in the proposed adventure,
the Concert of Europe continued to perform the
pacific symphony apparently in perfect accord.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
GERMANY'S TWO DATES
</span>
</p>

<p>
The policy of Germany, in 1912 and 1913, to
preserve peace, and her efforts&mdash;equally successful&mdash;in
the following year to provoke war, were probably
due to one and the same cause.  Two dates from
Germany's point of view were of supreme importance&mdash;<i>the
summer of 1914</i>, when her new military preparations
would be complete, and when the Kiel
Canal&mdash;having been widened and deepened[<a id="chap0306fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0306fn4">4</a>]&mdash;would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P276"></a>276}</span>
be available for the passage of Dreadnoughts; <i>the
summer of 1916</i>, by which date the French Army
increases were due to take effect, and the Russian
scheme of military reorganisation would have been
carried through.  From the point of view of Berlin
and Vienna war could be waged to greatest advantage
so soon as the first of these two dates had been
reached.  If, however, Italy, always a doubtful
participator, could have been tempted by self-interest
to make common cause with her allies in the summer
of 1913, the certainty of her adherence would have
turned the scales in favour of the earlier date.  For
Italy could put an army of 700,000 men into the
field; and this no doubt would have more than
compensated for the benefits which might have been
lost by anticipating the ideal moment by a year.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0306fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0306fn1text">1</a>] Germany took time by the forelock,
and began to carry through the
contemplated programme before disclosing
the terms of the Army Bill to
the legislature.  Consequently her intentions
were known in a general way
to every Intelligence department in Europe,
long before they were actually
announced.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0306fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0306fn2text">2</a>] In going through the memoranda upon
which this chapter is based, I
came across a paper written at the end
of July 1913 by a retired soldier
friend, in answer to a request on my part
for certain technical information
as to French and German preparations.
On the margin of the document,
which gives a very full and able analysis,
he had added the following postscript as an expression
of his personal opinion.  "<i>N.B.&mdash;Most Important</i>:
The German Bill takes immediate effect.
The French only takes effect
in 1916 because (1) the French are not
going to retain the class which
finishes its service this year with the colours;
(2) comparatively few are fit
for enrolment at twenty;
(3) there has been great delay in Parliament ... <i>A
year from now will be the critical time</i>.
Germany will have had the full
benefit from her Bill, whereas France
will have a mass of young recruits
still under instruction.
The strain on officers will be tremendous in order
to knock this mass of raw men into
shape."  It is rarely that a prophecy
is fulfilled practically to a day.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0306fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap0306fn3text">3</a>] Mr. Haldane, the Secretary of State for War,
in justifying this reduction
explained that 'his infantry was in excess,
the artillery was deficient.'  He
would rather not have cut off these
nine battalions, "but he could not use
them.  He had four more than he could
mobilise" (Auchterarder, December 29, 1906).
In his view "the first step to doing
anything for developing the
national basis of the Army was
to cut something off the Regular Forces"
(Newcastle, September 15, 1906).
"He did not think Compulsory Training
would be adopted in this country
until after England had been invaded
once or twice" (London, December 1, 1911).
The British, however, had
the best reasons for feeling secure:
they "were always a nation of splendid
fighters.  They were never ready,
but they fought the better the less
ready they were..."  (Glasgow, January 6, 1912).
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0306fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap0306fn4text">4</a>] On June 23, 1914, the Emperor William
opened the new lock at the
North Sea end of the Kiel Canal.
On the following day he performed the
same function at the Baltic end.
The <i>Times</i> correspondent remarks that
the Emperor's passage through the Canal
on this occasion was of symbolical
rather than practical significance,
as on the one hand German Dreadnoughts
had already used the widened passage
experimentally, while on the other
hand it would be a long time before
the whole work was finished.  He
continues: "The extension works,
which were begun in 1907, are, however,
of vast importance, especially to the Navy.
The Canal has been
made two metres deeper, and has been doubled
in breadth.  The places
at which large ships can pass one another
have been increased in number,
and at four of them Dreadnoughts can be turned.
There are now four,
instead of two, at each end,
which means a great saving of time in getting
a fleet through.  Above all,
the distance between Kiel and Wilhelmshaven
for battleship purposes is reduced
from more than 500 to only 80 nautical
miles.  The new locks at Brunsbttel
and Holtenau are the largest in the
world."&mdash;The <i>Times</i>, June 25, 1914.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
A TRAGEDY OF ERRORS
</h3>

<p>
It may be said&mdash;up to the very outbreak of war
it was said very frequently&mdash;that the mere power
and opportunity to make an outrageous attack are
nothing without the will to do so.  And this is true
enough.  Every barber who holds his client by the
nose could cut his throat as easily as shave his
chin.  Every horse could kick the groom, who rubs
him down, into the next world if he chose to do
so.  What sense, then, could there be in allowing
our minds to be disturbed by base suspicions of
our enterprising and cultured neighbour?  What
iota of proof was there that Germany nourished
evil thoughts, or was brooding on visions of conquest
and rapine?
</p>

<p>
So ran the argument of almost the whole Liberal
press; and a considerable portion of the Unionist
press echoed it.  Warnings were not heeded.  They
came only from unofficial quarters, and therefore
lacked authority.  Only the Government could have
spoken with authority; and the main concern of
members of the Government, when addressing
parliamentary or popular audiences, appeared to be to
prove that there was no need for anxiety.  They
went further in many instances, and denounced
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P278"></a>278}</span>
those persons who ventured to express a different
opinion from this, as either madmen or malefactors.
Nevertheless a good deal of proof had already
been published to the world&mdash;a good deal more was
known privately to the British Government&mdash;all of
which went to show that Germany had both the
will and intention to provoke war, if a favourable
opportunity for doing so should present itself.
</p>

<p>
For many years past&mdash;in a multitude of books,
pamphlets, leading articles, speeches, and university
lectures&mdash;the Germans had been scolding us, and
threatening us with attack at their own chosen
moment.  When Mr. Churchill stated bluntly, in
1912, that the German fleet was intended as a challenge
to the British Empire, he was only repeating, in
shorter form and more sober language, the boasts
which had been uttered with yearly increasing
emphasis and fury, by hundreds of German patriots
and professors.
</p>

<p>
With an engaging candour and in every fount of
type, unofficial Germany had made it abundantly
clear how she intended to carry her designs into
execution&mdash;how, first of all, France was to be crushed by a
swift and overwhelming attack&mdash;how Russia was then
to be punished at leisure&mdash;how after that, some of the
nations of Europe were to be forced into an alliance
against the British Empire, and the rest into a
neutrality favourable to Germany&mdash;how finally the
great war, which aimed at making an end of our
existence, was to begin.  And though, from time to
time, there were bland official utterances which
disavowed or ignored these outpourings, the outpourings
continued all the same.  And each year they became
more copious, and achieved a readier sale.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P279"></a>279}</span>
</p>

<p>
Those, however, who were responsible for British
policy appear to have given more credit to the
assurances of German diplomacy than to this mass
of popular incitement.  The British nation has
always chosen to plume itself upon the fact that the
hearts of British statesmen are stronger than their
heads; and possibly their amiable credulity, in the
present instance, might have been forgiven, had
their means of ascertaining truth been confined to
the statements of incontinent publicists and responsible
statesmen.  But there were other proofs available
besides words of either sort.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE FIRST WARNING
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Liberal Government came into office in the
autumn of 1905.  Ministers can hardly have had
time to master the contents of their various
portfolios, before German aggression burst rudely in
upon them.  Conceivably the too carefully calculating
diplomatists of Berlin had concluded, that the
principles of the new Cabinet would tend to keep England
neutral under any provocation, and that a heaven-sent
opportunity had therefore arrived for proceeding
with the first item in their programme by crushing
France.  It is a highly significant fact that early in
1906, only a few months after Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman's advent to power, he found himself
faced with the prospect of a European war, which
was only averted when our Foreign Minister made it
clear to Germany, that in such an event this country
would range herself upon the side of France.[<a id="chap0307fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P280"></a>280}</span>
</p>

<p>
This was the <i>first</i> warning.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE SECOND WARNING
</span>
</p>

<p>
The British answer to it was to utter renewed
protestations Of friendly confidence.  As an earnest of
our good intentions, the shipbuilding programme[<a id="chap0307fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn2">2</a>] of
the previous Government was immediately reduced.
The burden of armaments became the burden
of innumerable speeches.  In well-chosen words
Germany was coaxed and cajoled to acquiesce in
our continued command of the sea; but finding in our
action or inaction an opportunity for challenging it,
she turned a polite ear&mdash;but a deaf one&mdash;and pushed
forward her preparations with redoubled speed.  In
vain did we on our part slow down work at our new
naval base in the Firth of Forth.  In vain did we
reduce our slender army to even smaller dimensions.[<a id="chap0307fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn3">3</a>]  In
vain did we plead disinterestedly with Germany,
for a reduction in the pace of competition in naval
armaments, on the terms that we should be allowed
to possess a fleet nearly twice as strong as her
own.  For the most part, during this period, official
Germany remained discreetly silent, for the reason
that silence served her purpose best; but when the
persistency of our entreaties made some sort of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P281"></a>281}</span>
answer necessary, we were given to understand by
unofficial Germany&mdash;rather roughly and gruffly&mdash;that
a certain class of requests was inadmissible as
between gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly, having up to that time lulled
ourselves into the belief that our fine words had
actually succeeded in buttering parsnips, we
awoke&mdash;in the late autumn of 1908&mdash;to the truth, and fell
immediately into a fit of panic.  Panic increased
during the winter and following spring, and
culminated during the summer, in an Imperial Defence
Conference with the Dominions.
</p>

<p>
We had curtailed our shipbuilding programme
and slowed down our preparations.  Thereby we
had hoped to induce Germany to follow suit.  But
the effect had been precisely the opposite: she had
increased her programme and speeded up her
preparations.  At last our Government became alive
to what was going on, and in tones of reverberant
anxiety informed an astonished nation that the naval
estimates called for large additions.
</p>

<p>
Ministers, indeed, were between the devil and the
deep sea.  The supremacy of the British Fleet was
menaced; the conscience of the Radical party was
shocked&mdash;shocked not so much at the existence of the
menace as at official recognition of it, and at the
cost of insuring against it.  It was so much shocked,
indeed, that it took refuge in incredulity; and&mdash;upon
the strength of assurances which were of course
abundantly forthcoming from the German Admiralty,
who averred upon their honour that there had
been neither addition nor acceleration&mdash;roundly
accused its own anointed ministers of bearing false
witness against an innocent neighbour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P282"></a>282}</span>
</p>

<p>
None the less, large sums were voted, and the
Dominions came forward with generous contributions.
</p>

<p>
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, indeed, who had been nourished
and brought up on a diet of dried phrases, was
sceptical.  To this far-sighted statesman there appeared
to be no German menace either then or subsequently.
The whole thing was a mere nightmare,
disturbing the innocent sleep of Liberalism and
democracy.[<a id="chap0307fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
This was the <i>second</i> warning.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE THIRD WARNING
</span>
</p>

<p>
The <i>third</i> warning came in the form of subterranean
rumblings, inaudible to the general public, but clearly
heard by ministerial ears.
</p>

<p>
In July 1909, while the Imperial Conference on
Defence was in session, Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg
succeeded Prince Blow as German Chancellor.  Up
to that time there had been the menace of the
mailed fist, the rattling sabre, and the shining
armour.  Henceforward there was the additional
menace of a diplomacy playing for time, with a
careless and unconcealed contempt for the intelligence,
the courage, and the honour of the British
people and their statesmen.[<a id="chap0307fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn5">5</a>]  The German Government
had clearly formed the opinion that our
ministers were growing more and more afraid of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P283"></a>283}</span>
asking their party to support increased naval
estimates, and that it was only necessary to go on,
alternately dangling and withdrawing illusory
proposals for a naval understanding and a general
agreement, in order to steal ahead of us in the race.
Here, as in many other instances, the Germans had
observed not altogether incorrectly; but they had
drawn the wrong inference from the facts.
</p>

<p>
During the summer and autumn of 1910 was held
the famous but futile Constitutional Conference, the
primary object of which was to settle the quarrel
between the two Houses of Parliament.  With
steadily increasing clumsiness, German diplomacy,
through all this anxious time, was engaged in holding
out its hand and withdrawing it again; until even
men whose minds were worried with more immediate
cares, could no longer ignore the gravity of the
situation.
</p>

<p>
The Conference adjourned for the holiday season,
but resumed its sessions in October.  The public
assurances of those who took part in it on both sides
agree in this, that nothing except the special subject
for which it had been called into existence was ever
discussed at its meetings.  But many other things
were certainly discussed outside its meetings&mdash;on
the doorstep and the staircase, and in the
anterooms.  Among these topics the dangers of the
international situation, and the peril of imperial
security were the chief.
</p>

<p>
In October and November 1910 there was a great
secret of Polichinelle.  Conceivably we may learn
from some future historian even more about it than
we knew at the time.  All that need be said here
with reference to the matter is, that many persons on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P284"></a>284}</span>
both sides found themselves faced with a position of
affairs, where the security of the country plainly
required measures for its defence, of a character
and upon a scale, which neither political party could
hope to carry through Parliament and commend to
the country, unless it were supported by the more
responsible section of its opponents.
</p>

<p>
Neither party, however, was willing to pay the
price necessary for the support of the other, and
as a consequence imperial interests suffered.  It is
not necessary, however, to conclude from this lamentable
failure that a sordid spirit of faction was the
explanation.  In the constitutional sphere certain
principles were in conflict, which the parties
concerned had the honesty to hold by, but lacked the
sympathy, and possibly the intelligence, to adjust.
The acrimony of an immediate controversy distorted
the vision of those engaged in it; so that the
proportions of domestic and foreign dangers were
misjudged.
</p>

<p>
The failure of this constitutional conference was
welcomed at the time by exultant shoutings among
many, perhaps the majority, of the rank and file of
politicians upon both sides.  It was not so regarded,
however, by the country, which in a remarkable
degree refused to respond to the incitements of
violence and hatred with which it was plied during
the ensuing election.  There was at this time, for no
very definite reason, a widespread popular uneasiness,
and something approaching a general disgust with
politicians.
</p>

<p>
Among more considerate men on both sides, the
breakdown was frankly spoken of as one of the great
calamities in our political history.  It was more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P285"></a>285}</span>
than that.  It was in reality one of the greatest which
have ever befallen Europe.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE FOURTH WARNING
</span>
</p>

<p>
During the following July (1911), while in this
country we were deeply engaged in the bitter climax
of the constitutional struggle, there sounded a <i>fourth</i>
strident warning from the gong of the German
Chancellery.
</p>

<p>
The Agadir incident is one of the strangest which
have occurred in British history during recent years.
Its full gravity was not realised outside a very narrow
circle at the time of its occurrence; and when
subsequently it became more widely understood there was
a curious conspiracy to hush it up&mdash;or, perhaps, not
so much a conspiracy, as a general instinct of
concealment&mdash;a spontaneous gesture of modesty&mdash;as if
the British nation had been surprised bathing.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of July the German cruiser
<i>Panther</i> appeared at Agadir in Morocco.  This visit
was intended and understood as a direct challenge
to France.  Diplomacy was immediately in a stir.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks later Mr. Lloyd George spoke at the
Mansion House, making it clear that England would
not tolerate this encroachment.  Even amid the
anger and excitement which attended the last stages
of the Parliament Bill, this statement created a deep
impression throughout the country, and a still deeper
impression in other countries.
</p>

<p>
Then the crisis appeared to fade away.  Germany
was supposed to have become amenable.  We returned
to our internecine avocations.  The holiday
season claimed its votaries, and a great railway strike
upset many of their best-laid plans.  The inhabitants
of the United Kingdom are accustomed to think
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P286"></a>286}</span>
only on certain topics during August and September,
and it is hard to break them of their habits.  To
reconsider a crisis which had arisen and passed away
some two and a half months earlier, was more than
could be expected of us when we returned to work
in the autumn.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Lloyd George's speech was capable of
only one interpretation,&mdash;if Germany had persisted
in her encroachment, this country would have gone
to war in August or September 1911 in support of
France.  His words had no other meaning, and every
highly placed soldier and sailor was fully aware of
this fact, and made such preparations in his own
sphere as the case required.  But from what has
transpired subsequently, it does not seem at all clear
that more than two or three of the Cabinet in the
least realised what was happening.  Parliament did
not understand the situation any more than the
country did.
</p>

<p>
Later on, when people had time to concentrate
their minds on such matters, there was a thrill
of post-dated anxiety&mdash;a perturbation and
disapproval; criticism upon various points; a
transference of Mr. McKenna from the Admiralty to the
Home Office, and of Mr. Churchill from the Home
Office to the Admiralty.  Indignant anti-militarists,
supporters for the most part of the Government,
allowed themselves to be mysteriously reduced
to silence.  Business men, who had been shocked
when they learned the truth, suffered themselves to
be persuaded that even the truth must be taken
with a pinch of salt.  There was, in fact, a sort of
general agreement that it was better to leave the
summer embers undisturbed, lest a greater conflagration
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P287"></a>287}</span>
might ensue.  The attitude of the orthodox
politician was that of a nervous person who, hearing,
as he imagines, a burglar in his bedroom, feels happier
and safer when he shuts his eyes and pulls the blankets
over his head.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE FIFTH WARNING
</span>
</p>

<p>
A few months later, at the beginning of the
following year (1912), the <i>fifth</i> warning of the series
was delivered.
</p>

<p>
It differed from its predecessors inasmuch as it
was addressed to the ears of the British Government
alone.  Neither the Opposition nor the country heard
anything of it until more than two years later&mdash;until
the battles of Alsace, of Charleroi, and of Mons had
been lost&mdash;until the battle of the Marne had been
won&mdash;until the British Army was moving north to take up
a position in Flanders.  Then we learned that, when
Lord Haldane had visited Berlin in the month of
February 1912, he had done so at the special request
of the Kaiser, in order to consider how Anglo-German
misunderstandings might be removed.
</p>

<p>
Lord Haldane would have acted more wisely had
he stopped his journey <i>en route</i>, and never entered
Berlin at all.  For, two days before the date appointed
for his visit, proposals for large increases of the
German Army and Navy were laid before the
Reichstag.  His mission was to abate competition in
armaments, and here was an encouraging beginning!
Was it contempt, or insolence, or a design to overawe
the supposed timidity of the emissary; or was it
merely a blundering effort to steal a march in
the negotiations by facing the ambassador on his
arrival with a <i>fait accompli</i>?  Possibly it was a
combination of all these; but at any rate it was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P288"></a>288}</span>
exceedingly clumsy, and no less significant than
clumsy.
</p>

<p>
As to the mission&mdash;Germany was willing in a
vague way to 'retard'&mdash;whatever that may
mean&mdash;though not to abandon, or reduce, her naval
programme, providing the British Government would
agree to remain neutral in any war which Germany
might choose to wage.  France might be crushed
and Belgium annexed; but in either event England
must stand aside and wait her turn.  On no other
terms would the Kaiser consent to a <i>rapprochement</i>
with this country, or allow the blessed words
'retardation of the naval programme' to be uttered
by official lips.
</p>

<p>
An undertaking of this tenor went beyond those
assurances of non-aggressive intent which Lord
Haldane, on behalf of his own Government, was
fully prepared to give.  We would not be a party
to any unprovoked attack on Germany&mdash;was not
that sufficient?  It was plainly insufficient.  It was
made clear that Germany desired a free hand to
establish herself in a position of supremacy astride
of Europe.  So Lord Haldane returned profitless
from his wayfaring, and the British Government was
at its wits' end how to placate the implacable.
</p>

<p>
The way they chose was well-doing, in which
they wearied themselves perhaps overmuch, especially
during the Balkan negotiations.  For Germany did
not want war at that time, for the reasons which
have been given already.  And so, rather surlily, and
with the air of one who was humouring a crank&mdash;a
pusillanimous people whose fixed idea was
pacifism&mdash;she consented that we should put ourselves to
vast trouble to keep the peace for her benefit.  If
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P289"></a>289}</span>
war had to come in the end, it had much better have
come then&mdash;so far as we were concerned&mdash;seeing
that the combined balance of naval and military
power was less unfavourable to the Triple Entente
at the beginning of 1913 than it was some fifteen
months later....  This was all the notice we took
of the fifth warning.  We earned no gratitude by
our activities, nor added in any way thereby to our
own safety.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE HALDANE MISSION
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Haldane mission is a puzzle from first to last.
The Kaiser had asked that he should be sent....
For what purpose? ... Apparently in order to
discuss the foreign policy of England and Germany.
But surely the Kaiser should have been told that we
kept an Ambassador at Berlin for this very purpose;
an able man, habituated to stand in the strong
sunlight of the imperial presence without losing his
head; but, above all, qualified to converse on such
matters (seeing that they lay within his own province)
far better than the most profound jurist in Christendom.
Or if our Ambassador at Berlin could not say
what was required, the German Ambassador in London
might easily have paid a visit to Downing Street;
or the Foreign Ministers of the two countries might
have arranged a meeting; or even the British Premier
and the German Chancellor might have contrived to
come together.  Any of these ways would have been
more natural, more proper, more likely (one would
think) to lead to business, than the way which was
followed.
</p>

<p>
One guesses that the desire of the Kaiser that
Lord Haldane should be sent, was met half-way by
the desire of Lord Haldane to go forth; that there
was some temperamental affinity between these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P290"></a>290}</span>
two pre-eminent characters&mdash;some attraction of
opposites, like that of the python and the rabbit.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the reasons may have been for this
visit, the results of it were bad, and indeed disastrous.
To have accepted the invitation was to fall into a
German trap; a trap which had been so often set
that one might have supposed it was familiar to
every Foreign Office in Europe!  Berlin has long
delighted in these extra-official enterprises,
undertaken behind the backs of accredited representatives.
Confidences are exchanged; explanations are offered
'in the frankest spirit'; sometimes understandings
of a kind are arrived at.  But so far as Germany is
concerned, nothing of all this is binding, unless her
subsequent interests make it desirable that it should
be.  The names of the irregular emissaries, German,
British, and cosmopolitan, whom the Kaiser has
sent to London and received at Berlin&mdash;unbeknown
to his own Foreign Office&mdash;since the beginning of his
reign, would fill a large and very interesting visitors'
book.  One would have imagined that even so early
as February 1912 this favourite device had been found
out and discredited even in Downing Street.
</p>

<p>
Lord Haldane was perhaps even less well fitted
for such an embassy by temperament and habit of
mind, than he was by position and experience.
Lawyer-statesmanship, of the modern democratic
sort, is of all forms of human agency the one least
likely to achieve anything at Potsdam.  The British
emissary was tireless, industrious, and equable.
His colleagues, on the other hand, were overworked,
indolent, or flustered.  Ready on the shortest notice
to mind everybody else's business, he was allowed
to mind far too much of it; and he appears to have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P291"></a>291}</span>
minded most of it rather ill than well.  He was no
more suited to act for the Foreign Office than King
Alfred was to watch the housewife's cakes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE HALDANE MISSION
</span>
</p>

<p>
The man whose heart swells with pride in his own
ingenuity usually walks all his life in blinkers.  It is
not surprising that Lord Haldane's visit to the Kaiser
was a failure, that it awoke distrust at the time, or
that it opened the way to endless misrepresentation in
the future.  What surprises is his stoicism; that he
should subsequently have shown so few signs of
disappointment, distress, or mortification; that he
should have continued up to the present moment to
hold himself out as an expert on German psychology;[<a id="chap0307fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn6">6</a>]
that he should be still upheld by his journalistic
admirers, to such an extent that they even write
pamphlets setting out to his credit 'what he did to
thwart Germany.'[<a id="chap0307fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
We have been told by Mr. Asquith,[<a id="chap0307fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn8">8</a>] what was
thought by the British Government of the outcome
of Lord Haldane's embassy.  We have also been
informed by Germany, what was thought of it by
high officials at Berlin; what inferences they drew
from these conversations; what hopes they founded
upon them.  We do not know, however, what was
thought of the incident by the other two members
of the Entente; how it impressed the statesmen of
Paris and Petrograd; for they must have known
of the occurrence&mdash;the English representative not
being one whose comings and goings would easily
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P292"></a>292}</span>
escape notice.  The British people were told nothing;
they knew nothing; and therefore, naturally enough,
they thought nothing about the matter.
</p>

<p>
The British Cabinet&mdash;if Mr. Asquith's memory is
to be relied on&mdash;saw through the devilish designs of
Germany so soon as Lord Haldane, upon his return,
unbosomed himself to the conclave in quaking
whispers.  We know from the Prime Minister, that
when he heard how the Kaiser demanded a free hand
for European conquests, as the price of a friendly
understanding with England, the scales dropped
from his eyes, and he realised at once that this merely
meant the eating of us up later.  But one cannot
help wondering, since Mr. Asquith was apparently
so clear-sighted about the whole matter, that he
made no preparations whatsoever&mdash;military, financial,
industrial, or even naval (beyond the ordinary
routine)&mdash;against an explosion which&mdash;the mood and
intentions of Germany being what they were now
recognised to be&mdash;might occur at any moment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
COST OF AMATEUR DIPLOMACY
</span>
</p>

<p>
As to what Germany thought of the incident we
know of course only what the high personages at
Berlin have been pleased to tell the world about
their 'sincere impressions.'  They have been very
busy doing this&mdash;hand upon heart as their wont
is&mdash;in America and elsewhere.  According to their own
account they gathered from Lord Haldane's mission
that the British Government and people were very
much averse from being drawn into European
conflicts; that we now regretted having gone quite
so far as we had done in the past, in the way of
entanglements and understandings; that while we
could not stand by, if any other country was being
threatened directly on account of arrangements it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P293"></a>293}</span>
had come to with England, England certainly was
by no means disposed to seek officiously for
opportunities of knight-errantry.  In simple words the
cases of Tangier and Agadir were coloured by a
special obligation, and were to be distinguished
clearly from anything in the nature of a general
obligation or alliance with France and Russia.
</p>

<p>
It is quite incredible that Lord Haldane ever said
anything of this kind; for he would have been four
times over a traitor if he had&mdash;to France; to
Belgium; to his own country; also to Germany
whom he would thus have misled.  It is also all
but incredible that a single high official at Berlin
ever understood him to have spoken in this sense.
But this is what the high officials have assured
their own countrymen and the whole of the neutral
world that they did understand; and they have
called piteously on mankind to witness, how false
the British Government was to an honourable
understanding, so soon as trouble arose in July
last with regard to Servia.  Such are some of the
penalties we have paid for the luxury of indulging
in amateur diplomacy.
</p>

<p>
The German bureaucracy, however, always presses
things too far.  It is not a little like Fag in <i>The
Rivals</i>&mdash;"whenever it draws on its invention for a
good current lie, it always forges the endorsements
as well as the bill."  As a proof that the relations of
the two countries from this time forward were of the
best, inferences have been drawn industriously by
the high officials at Berlin as to the meaning and
extent of Anglo-German co-operation during the
Balkan wars; as to agreements with regard to Africa
already signed, but not published, in which Downing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P294"></a>294}</span>
Street had shown itself 'surprisingly accommodating';
as to other agreements with regard to the Baghdad
Railway, the Mesopotamian oil-fields, the navigation
of the Tigris, and access through Basra to the Persian
Gulf.  These agreements, the earnest of a new
<i>entente</i> between the Teuton nations&mdash;the United
States subsequently to be welcomed in&mdash;are alleged
to have been already concluded, signed and awaiting
publication when war broke out.[<a id="chap0307fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn9">9</a>]  Then trouble
arises in Servia; a mere police business&mdash;nothing
more&mdash;which might have been settled in a few days
or at any rate weeks, if perfidious Albion had not
seized the opportunity to work upon Muscovite
suspicions, in order to provoke a world-war for which
she had been scheming all the time!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE SIXTH WARNING
</span>
</p>

<p>
The <i>sixth</i> warning was the enormous German
Army Bill and the accompanying war loan of 1913.
By comparison, the five previous warnings were but
ambiguous whispers.  And yet this last reverberation
had apparently no more effect upon the British
Government than any of the rest.
</p>

<p>
With all these numerous premonitions the puzzle
is, how any government could have remained in
doubt as to the will of Germany to wage war whenever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P295"></a>295}</span>
her power seemed adequate and the opportunity
favourable for winning it.  The favourite plea that
the hearts of Mr. Asquith and his colleagues were
stronger than their heads does not earn much respect.
Knowing what we do of them in domestic politics,
this excuse would seem to put the quality of their
heads unduly low.  The true explanation of their
omissions must be sought elsewhere than in their
intellects and affections.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is important to remember that none of the
considerations which have been set out in this chapter
can possibly have been hidden from the Foreign
Office, the War Office, the Admiralty, the Prime
Minister, the Committee of Imperial Defence, or
the inner or outer circles of the Cabinet.  Important
papers upon matters of this kind go the round
of the chief ministers.  Unless British public
offices have lately fallen into a state of more
than Turkish indolence, of more than German
miscalculation, it is inconceivable that the true
features of the situation were not laid before ministers,
dinned into ministers, proved and expounded to
ministers, by faithful officials, alive to the dangers
which were growing steadily but rapidly with each
succeeding year.  And although we may only surmise
the vigilant activity of these subordinates, we do
actually know, that Mr. Asquith's Government was
warned of them, time and again, by other persons
unconcerned in party politics and well qualified to
speak.
</p>

<p>
But supposing that no one had told them, they
had their own wits and senses, and these were surely
enough.  A body of men whose first duty is the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P296"></a>296}</span>
preservation of national security&mdash;who are trusted to
attend to that task, paid for performing it, honoured
under the belief that they do attend to it and perform
it&mdash;cannot plead, in excuse for their failure, that no
one had jogged their elbows, roused them from their
slumbers or their diversions, and reminded them of
their duty.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
INACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT
</span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Asquith and his chief colleagues must have
realised the interdependence of policy and
armaments; and they must have known, from the year
1906 onwards, that on the military side our armaments
were utterly inadequate to maintain our policy.
They must have known that each year, force of
circumstances was tending more and more to
consolidate the Triple Entente into an alliance, as the
only means of maintaining the balance of power,
which was a condition both of the freedom of Europe
and of British security.  They knew&mdash;there can be
no doubt on this point&mdash;what an immense numerical
superiority of armed forces Germany and Austria
together could bring, first against France at the
<i>onset</i> of war, and subsequently, at their leisure,
against Russia during the <i>grip</i> of war.  They
knew that a British Expeditionary Army of 160,000
men would not make good the difference&mdash;would
come nowhere near making good the difference.
They must have known that from the point of view
of France and Belgium, the special danger of modern
warfare was the crushing rapidity of its opening
phase.  They must have been kept fully informed
of all the changes which were taking place in the
military situation upon the continent to the
detriment of the Triple Entente.  They had watched the
Balkan war and measured its effects.  They knew
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P297"></a>297}</span>
the meanings of the critical dates&mdash;1914-1916&mdash;better,
we may be sure, than any section of their
fellow-countrymen.  And even although they might
choose to disregard, as mere jingoism, all the boasts
and denunciations of German journalists and
professors, they must surely have remembered the events
which preceded the conference at Algeciras, and
those others which led up to the Defence Conference
of 1909.  They can hardly have forgotten the
anxieties which had burdened their hearts during
the autumn of 1910.  Agadir cannot have been
forgotten; the memory of Lord Haldane's rebuff was
still green; and the spectre of the latest German Army
Bill must have haunted them in their dreams.
</p>

<p>
There is here no question of being wise after the
event.  The meaning of each of these things in turn
was brought home to the Prime Minister and his
chief colleagues as it occurred&mdash;firstly, we may be
sure, by their own intelligence&mdash;secondly, we may
be equally sure, by the reports of their responsible
subordinates&mdash;thirdly, by persons of knowledge and
experience, who had no axe to grind or interest to
serve.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore absurd to suppose that ministers
could have failed to realise the extent of the danger,
or of our unpreparedness to meet it, unless they
had purposely buried their heads in the sand.  They
knew that they had not a big enough army, and
that this fact might ruin their whole policy.  Why
did they never say so?  Why, when Lord Roberts
said so, did they treat him with contumely, and
make every effort to discredit him?  Why was
nothing done by them during their whole period of
office to increase the Army and thereby diminish the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P298"></a>298}</span>
numerical superiority of their adversaries.  On the
contrary, they actually reduced the Army, assuring
the country that they had no use for so many trained
soldiers.  Moreover, the timidity or secretiveness of
the Government prevented England from having,
what is worth several army corps, and what proved
the salvation of France&mdash;a National Policy, fully
agreed and appealing to the hearts and consciences of
the whole people.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The answers to these questions must be sought
in another sphere.  The political situation was one
of great perplexity at home as well as abroad, and
its inherent difficulties were immeasurably increased
by the character and temperament of Mr. Asquith,
by the nature no less of his talents than of his
defects.  The policy of wait-and-see is not necessarily
despicable.  There are periods in which it has
been the surest wisdom and the truest courage; but
this was not one of those periods, nor was there
safety in dealing either with Ireland or with Germany
upon this principle.  When a country is fully prepared
it can afford to wait and see if there will be a
war; but not otherwise.
</p>

Sir Edward Grey is a statesman whose integrity
and disinterestedness have never been impugned by
friend or foe; but from the very beginning of his
tenure of office he has appeared to lack that supreme
quality of belief in himself which stamps the greatest
foreign ministers.  He has seemed at times to hesitate,
as if in doubt whether the dangers which he foresaw
with his mind's eye were realities, or only nightmares
produced by his own over-anxiety.  We have a
feeling also that in the conduct of his office he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P299"></a>299}</span>
played too lonely a part, and that such advice and
sympathy as he had received were for the most part
of the wrong sort.  What he needed in the way of
counsel and companionship was simplicity and resolution.
What he had to rely on was the very reverse
of this.
</p>

<p>
Lord Haldane, as we have learned recently, shared
largely in the work of the Foreign Office; a man
of prodigious industry, but over-ingenious, and of
a self-complacency which too readily beguiled him
into the belief that there was no opponent who could
not be satisfied, no obstacle which could not be made
to vanish&mdash;by argument.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
SIR EDWARD GREY'S DIFFICULTIES
</span>
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Sir Edward Grey had to contend
against enemies within his own household.  In the
Liberal party there was a tradition, which has never
been entirely shaken off, that all increase of
armaments is provocative, and that all foreign
engagements are contrary to the public interest.  After the
Agadir crisis he was made the object of a special
attack by a large and influential section of his own
party and press, and was roundly declared to be no
longer possible as Foreign Minister.[<a id="chap0307fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn10">10</a>]  There can be
no doubt that the attempt to force Sir Edward Grey's
resignation in the winter 1911-1912 was fomented
by German misrepresentation and intrigue, skilfully
acting upon the peculiar susceptibilities of radical
fanaticism.  Nor is there any doubt that the attacks
which were made upon the policy of Mr. Churchill,
from the autumn of 1912 onwards, were fostered by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P300"></a>300}</span>
the same agency, using the same tools, and aiming
at the same objects.
</p>

<p>
The orthodoxy of Mr. Churchill was suspect on
account of his Tory ancestry and recent conversion;
that of Sir Edward Grey on the ground that he was
a country gentleman, bred in aristocratic traditions,
trained in Foreign Affairs under the dangerous
influences of Lord Rosebery, and therefore incapable
of understanding the democratic dogma that loving-kindness
will conquer everything, including Prussian
ambitions.
</p>

<p>
Surely no very vivid imagination is needed to
penetrate the mystery of Cabinet discussions on
defence for several years before war broke out.
Behind the Cabinet, as the Cabinet well knew, was a
party, one half of which was honestly oblivious of all
danger, while the other half feared the danger much
less than it hated the only remedy.  Clearly the bulk of
the Cabinet was in cordial sympathy either with one or
other of these two sections of their party.  Sir Edward
Grey accordingly had to defend his policy against
an immense preponderance of settled convictions,
political prejudices, and personal interests.  And
at the same time he seems to have been haunted
by the doubt lest, after all, his fears were only
nightmares.  Mr. Churchill, there is no difficulty in seeing,
must have fought very gallantly; but always, for
the reason already given, with one hand tied behind
his back.  He had all his work cut out to maintain
the Navy, which was under his charge, in a state of
efficiency; and this upon the whole he succeeded in
doing pretty efficiently.[<a id="chap0307fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P301"></a>301}</span>
</p>

<p>
If we may argue back from public utterances to
Cabinet discussions, it would appear that the only
assistance&mdash;if indeed it deserved such a name&mdash;which
was forthcoming to these two, proceeded from
Mr. Asquith and Lord Haldane.  The former was by
temperament opposed to clear decisions and vigorous
action.  The latter&mdash;to whom the mind of Germany
was as an open book&mdash;bemused himself, and seems
to have succeeded in bemusing his colleagues to
almost as great an extent.
</p>

<p>
In fancy, we can conjure up a scene which
must have been enacted, and re-enacted, very often
at Number 10 Downing Street in recent years.  We
can hear the warnings of the Foreign Minister, the
urgent pleas of the First Lord of the Admiralty, the
scepticism, indifference, or hostility expressed by the
preponderant, though leaderless, majority in the
Cabinet.  <i>Simple</i> said, <i>I see no danger</i>; <i>Sloth</i> said,
<i>Yet a little more sleep</i>; and <i>Presumption</i> said, <i>Every
Vat must stand upon his own bottom</i>....  We can
almost distinguish the tones of their Right Honourable
voices.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
EXCESSIVE TIMIDITY
</span>
</p>

<p>
The situation was governed by an excessive
timidity&mdash;by fear of colleagues, of the caucus, of the
party, and of public opinion&mdash;by fear also of Germany.
Mr. Asquith, and the Cabinet of which he was
the head, refused to look their policy between the
eyes, and realise what it was, and what were its
inevitable consequences.  They would not admit that
the <i>Balance of Power</i> was an English interest, or that
they were in any way concerned in maintaining it.
They would not admit that our Entente with France
and Russia was in fact an alliance.  They thought
they could send British officers to arrange plans of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P302"></a>302}</span>
campaign with the French General Staff&mdash;could learn
from this source all the secret hopes and anxieties of
France&mdash;could also withdraw the greater part of their
fleet from the Mediterranean, under arrangement
for naval co-operation with our present ally[<a id="chap0307fn12text"></a><a href="#chap0307fn12">12</a>]&mdash;all
without committing this country to any
form of understanding!  They boasted that they had
no engagements with France, which puzzled the
French and the Russians, and convinced nobody;
save possibly themselves, and a section of their own
followers.  They had in fact bound the country to a
course of action&mdash;in certain events which were not at
all improbable&mdash;just as surely by drifting into a
committal, as if they had signed and sealed a parchment.
Yet they would not face the imperative condition.
They would not place their armaments on a footing
to correspond with their policy.
</p>

<p>
Much of this is now admitted more or less frankly,
but justification is pleaded, in that it was essential to
lead the country cautiously, and that the Government
could do nothing unless it had the people behind it.
In these sayings there is a measure of truth.  But as a
matter of fact the country was not led at all.  It was
trapped.  Never was there the slightest effort made
by any member of the Government to educate
the people with regard to the national dangers,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P303"></a>303}</span>
responsibilities, and duties.  When the crisis occurred
the hand of the whole British Empire was forced.
There was no other way; but it was a bad
way.  And what was infinitely worse, was the fact
that, when war was declared&mdash;that war which had
been discussed at so many Cabinet meetings since
1906&mdash;military preparations were found to be utterly
inadequate in numbers; and in many things other
than numbers.  The politician is right in thinking
that, as a rule, it is to his advantage if the people are
behind him; but there are times when we can imagine
him praying that they may not be too close.
</p>

<p>
We have been given to understand that it was
impossible for the Government to acknowledge their
policy frankly, to face the consequences, and to
insist upon the necessary preparations in men and
material being granted.  It was impossible, because
to have done so would have broken the Liberal
party&mdash;that great instrument for good&mdash;in twain.
The Cabinet would have fallen in ruin.  The careers
of its most distinguished members would have been
cut short.  Consider what sacrifices would have been
contained in this catalogue of disasters.
</p>

<p>
That is really what we are now beginning to consider,
and are likely to consider more and more as
time goes on.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
VALUE OF SELF-SACRIFICE
</span>
</p>

<p>
A great act of self-sacrifice&mdash;a man's, or a
party's&mdash;may sometimes make heedless people realise the
presence of danger when nothing else will.  Suppose
Mr. Asquith had said, "I will only continue to hold
office on one condition," and had named the
condition&mdash;'that armaments should correspond to
policy'&mdash;the only means of safety.  He might thereupon have
disappeared into the chasm; but like Curtius he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P304"></a>304}</span>
might have saved the City.  It would have made
a great impression, Mr. Asquith falling from office
for his principles.  Those passages of Periclean
spoken after war broke out, about the
crime of Germany against humanity&mdash;about sacrificing
our own ease&mdash;about duty, honour, freedom,
and the like&mdash;were wonderfully moving.  Would
there, however, have been occasion for them, if in
the orator's own case, the sacrifice had been made
before the event instead of after it, or if he had
faithfully performed the simplest and chief of all
the duties attaching to his great position?
</p>

<p>
The present war, as many of us thought, and still
think, was not inevitable.  None have maintained
this opinion in the past with greater vehemence
than the Liberal party.  But the conditions on
which it could have been avoided were, that England
should have been prepared, which she was not; and
that she should have spoken her intentions clearly,
which she did not.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE PRICE PAID
</span>
</p>

<p>
When the war is ended, or when the tide of it has
turned and begun to sweep eastward, there will be
much coming and going of the older people, and of
women, both young and old, between England and
France.  They have waited, and what is it that they
will then be setting forth to see? ... From Mons
to the Marne, and back again to Ypres, heaps of
earth, big and little, shapeless, nameless, numberless&mdash;the
graves of men who did not hesitate to sacrifice
either their careers or their lives when duty called
them.  Desolation is the heaviest sacrifice of all;
and those who will, by and by, go on this pilgrimage
have suffered it, ungrudgingly and with pride,
because their country needed it.  If this war was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P305"></a>305}</span>
indeed inevitable there is no more to be said.  But
what if it was not inevitable?  What if there would
have been no war at all&mdash;or a less lingering and
murderous war&mdash;supposing that those, who from the
trust reposed in them by their fellow-countrymen
should have been the first to sacrifice their careers
to duty, had not chosen instead to sacrifice duty to
their careers?  It was no doubt a service to humanity
to save the careers of politicians from extinction,
to keep ministers in office from year to year, to
preserve the Liberal party&mdash;that great instrument
for good&mdash;unfractured.  These benefits were worth
a great price; but were they worth quite so great a
price as has been paid?

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
THE BRITISH ARMY AND THE PEACE OF EUROPE
</h3>

<p>
Many people who were not in the habit of concerning
themselves with party politics endeavoured, during
the autumn of 1911, and from that time forward,
to straighten out their ideas on the twin problems
of Foreign Policy and Defence.  They were moved
thereto mainly by the Agadir incident.  Moreover,
a year later, the Balkan war provided an object lesson
in the success of sudden onset against an unprepared
enemy.  Gradually also, more and more attention
was focussed upon the large annual increases in
preparation of the warlike sort, which successive
budgets, presented to the Reichstag, had been unable
to hide away.  In addition to these, came, early in
1913, the sensational expansion of the German military
establishment and the French reply to it, which have
already been considered.
</p>

<p>
Private enquirers of course knew nothing of Lord
Haldane's rebuff at Berlin in 1912, for that was a
Government secret.  Nor had they any means of
understanding more than a portion of what was
actually afoot on the Continent of Europe in the
matter of armaments and military preparations.
Their sole sources of information were official papers
and public discussions.  Many additional facts beyond
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P310"></a>310}</span>
these are brought to the notice of governments through
their secret intelligence departments.  All continental
powers are more or less uncandid, both as regards
the direction and the amount of their expenditure
on armaments.  In the case of Germany concealment
is practised on a greater scale and more methodically
than with any other.  Ministers obviously knew a
great deal more than the British public; but what
was known to the man-in-the-street was sufficiently
disquieting, when he set himself to puzzle out its
meanings.
</p>

<p>
At this time (during 1912, and in the first half
of 1913, until anxiety with regard to Ireland
began to absorb public attention) there was a very
widely-spread and rapidly-growing concern as to
the security of the country.  For nearly seven
years Lord Roberts, with quiet constancy, had been
addressing thin and, for the most part, inanimate
gatherings on the subject of National Service.
Suddenly he found himself being listened to with
attention and respect by crowded audiences.
</p>

<p>
Lord Roberts had ceased to be Commander-in-Chief
in 1904.  After his retirement, and in the
same year, he revisited the South African battlefields.
During this trip, very reluctantly&mdash;for he
was no lover of change&mdash;he came to the conclusion
that in existing circumstances 'national service'
was a necessity.  On his return to England he
endeavoured to persuade Mr. Balfour's Government
to accept his views and give effect to them.  Failing
in this, he resigned his seat upon the Committee of
Imperial Defence in 1905, in order that he might be
able to advocate his opinion freely.  He was then
in his seventy-fourth year.  It was not, however,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P311"></a>311}</span>
until seven years later[<a id="chap0401fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn1">1</a>] that his words can be said
to have arrested general attention.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NATIONAL ANXIETY
</span>
</p>

<p>
The truth was that the nation was beginning to
be dissatisfied with what it had been told by the
party speakers and newspapers, on the one side
and the other, regarding the state of the national
defences.  It had not even the consolation of feeling
that what the one said might be set against the
other, and truth arrived at by striking a balance
between them.  This method of the party system,
which was supposed to have served fairly well in
other matters, failed to reassure the nation with
regard to its military preparations.  The whole of
this subject was highly complicated, lent itself readily
to political mystery, and produced in existing
circumstances the same apprehensions among ordinary men
as those of a nervous pedestrian, lost in a fog by the
wharf side, who finds himself beset by officious and
quarrelsome touts, each claiming permission to set
him on his way.
</p>

<p>
The nation was disquieted because it knew that
it had not been told the whole truth by either set of
politicians.  It suspected the reason of this to be
that neither set had ever taken pains to understand
where the truth lay.  It had a notion, moreover,
that the few who really knew, were afraid&mdash;for party
reasons&mdash;to speak out, to state their conclusions, and
to propose the proper remedies, lest such a course
might drive them from office, or prevent them from
ever holding it.  Beyond any doubt it was true that
at this time many people were seriously disturbed
by the unsatisfactory character of recent Parliamentary
discussions, and earnestly desired to know
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P312"></a>312}</span>
the real nature of the dangers to be apprehended,
and the adequacy of our preparations for meeting
them.
</p>

<p>
There had always been a difficulty in keeping
the Army question from being used as a weapon in
party warfare.  As to this&mdash;looking back over a long
period of years&mdash;there was not much to choose between
the Radicals, Liberals, or Whigs upon the one hand,
and the Unionists, Conservatives, or Tories on the
other.  Military affairs are complicated and
technical; and the very fact that the line of country is
so puzzling to the ordinary man had preserved it as
the happy hunting-ground of the politician.  When
an opportunity presented itself of attacking the
Government on its army policy, the opposition&mdash;whether
in the reign of Queen Victoria or in that of
Queen Anne&mdash;rarely flinched out of any regard for
the national interest.  And when Parliamentary
considerations and ingrained prejudices made it seem a
risky matter to undertake reforms which were
important, or even essential, the Government of the
day just as rarely showed any disposition to discharge
this unpopular duty.
</p>

<p>
While at times naval policy, and even foreign
policy, had for years together been removed out of
the region of purely party criticism, army policy had
ever remained embarrassed by an evil tradition.
From the time of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough,
to the time of Field-Marshal Sir John French&mdash;from
a date, that is, only a few years after our modern
Parliamentary system was inaugurated by the 'Glorious
Revolution,' down to the present day&mdash;the
characteristic of almost every opposition with regard
to this matter, had been factiousness, and that of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P313"></a>313}</span>
almost every Government evasion.  Neither the one
side nor the other had ever seemed able to approach
this ill-fated topic with courage or sincerity, or to
view it with steady constancy from the standpoint
of the national interest.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE BLOOD TAXES
</span>
</p>

<p>
For several years past the country had been
watching a conspicuous example of this ingrained
habit of manoeuvring round the Army in order to
obtain party advantage.  From 1912 onwards, until
more interesting perplexities provided a distraction,
a great part of the Liberal press and party had been
actively engaged in the attempt to fix the Unionist
party with responsibility for the proposals of the
National Service League.  The Opposition, it is
hardly necessary to record, were innocent of this
charge&mdash;criminally innocent; but it was nevertheless
regarded as good party business to load them
with the odium of 'conscription.'  The 'blood-taxes,'
as it was pointed out by one particularly
zealous journal, would be no less useful than the
'food-taxes' as an 'election cry,' which at this
time&mdash;more than ever before&mdash;appeared to have become
the be-all and end-all of party activities.
</p>

<p>
It was obvious to the meanest capacity that
these industrious politicians were not nearly so much
concerned with the demerits, real or supposed, of
National Service, as with making their opponents
as unpopular as possible.  In such an atmosphere
of prejudice it would have required great courage
and determination in a statesman to seek out and
proclaim the true way to security, were it national
service or anything else which entailed a sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Was it wonderful that when people examined
the signs of the times in the early part of 1913,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P314"></a>314}</span>
they should have found themselves oppressed by
feelings of doubt and insecurity?  A huge German
military increase; a desperate French effort in
reply; war loans (for they were nothing else) on a
vast scale in both countries&mdash;what was the meaning
of it all?  To what extent was British safety
jeopardised thereby?
</p>

<p>
To these questions there was no answer which
carried authority; the official oracles were dumb.
We are a democratic country, and yet none of our
rulers had ever yet spoken plainly to us.  None of
the Secretaries for War, none of the Prime Ministers
since the beginning of the century, had ever stated
the issue with uncompromising simplicity, as the
case required.  None of them had ever taken the
country into his confidence, either as to the extent
of the danger or as to the nature of the remedy.  It
is necessary to assume&mdash;in the light of subsequent
events&mdash;that these statesmen had in fact realised
the danger, and were not ignorant of the preparations
which were required to forestall it.  Certainly it
is hard to believe otherwise; but at times, remembering
their speeches and their acts, one is inclined to
give them the benefit, if it be a benefit, of the doubt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
BRITAIN AND EUROPEAN INTERESTS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The question at issue was in reality a graver matter
than the security of the United Kingdom or the
British Empire.  The outlook was wider even than
this.  The best guarantee for the preservation of
the peace of Europe, and of the World, would have
been a British army proportionate to our population
and resources.  There could be no doubt of this.
For half a century or more we had, half unconsciously,
bluffed Europe into the belief that we did in fact
possess such an army; but gradually it had become
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P315"></a>315}</span>
plain that this was not the case.  Since the Agadir
incident the real situation was apparent even to the
man in the street&mdash;in Paris, Berlin, Brussels, the
Hague, Vienna, Rome, and Petrograd&mdash;in every
capital, indeed, save perhaps in London alone.
</p>

<p>
If England had possessed such an army as would
have enabled her to intervene with effect in European
affairs, she would almost certainly never have been
called upon to intervene.[<a id="chap0401fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn2">2</a>]  Peace in that case would
have preserved itself.  For Europe knew&mdash;not from
our professions, but from the obvious facts, which
are a much better assurance&mdash;that our army would
never be used except for one purpose only, <i>to maintain
the balance of Power</i>.  She knew this to be our only
serious concern; and, except for the single nation
which, at any given time, might be aiming at
predominance, it was also the most serious concern of
the whole of Europe.  She knew us to be disinterested,
in the diplomatic sense, with regard to all other
European matters.  She knew that there was nothing
in Europe which we wished to acquire, and nothing&mdash;save
in the extreme south-west, a rock called
Gibraltar, and in the Mediterranean an island called
Malta&mdash;which we held and were determined to maintain.
In the chancelleries of Europe all this was
clearly recognised.  And more and more it was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P316"></a>316}</span>
coming to be recognised also by the organs of public
opinion on the Continent.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The population of France is roughly forty millions;
that of Germany} sixty-five millions; that of the
United Kingdom, forty-five millions.  As regards
numbers of men trained to bear arms, France by
1911 had already come to the end of her resources;
Germany had still considerable means of expansion;
Britain alone had not yet seriously attempted to
put forth her strength.  Had we done so in time
the effect must have been final and decisive; there
would then have been full security against disturbance
of the peace of Europe by a deliberately calculated
war.
</p>

<p>
Europe's greatest need therefore was that Britain
should possess an army formidable not only in valour,
but also in numbers: her greatest peril lay in the
fact that, as to the second of these requirements,
Britain was deficient.  No power from the Atlantic
seaboard to the Ural Mountains, save that one
alone which contemplated the conquest and spoliation
of its neighbours, would have been disquieted&mdash;or
indeed anything else but reassured&mdash;had the British
people decided to create such an army.  For by
reason of England's peculiar interests&mdash;or rather
perhaps from her lack of all direct personal interests
in European affairs, other than in peace and the
balance of power&mdash;she was marked out as the natural
mediator in Continental disputes.  In these high
perplexities, however, it is not the justice of the
mediator which restrains aggression, so much as
the fear inspired by his fleets and the strength of
his battalions.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
THE COMPOSITION OF THE BRITISH ARMY
</h3>

<p>
The doubt and anxiety of public opinion in 1912
were not allayed when the strength and composition
of the British Army came to be considered.
</p>

<p>
Leaving out of account those troops which were
recruited and maintained in India, the Dominions,
and the Dependencies, the actual number of British
regulars employed in garrison duty abroad was in
round figures 125,000 men.  The number in the
United Kingdom was approximately the same; but
by no means the whole of these were fit to take the
field.  The total strength of the <i>Regular Army</i> in
1912-1913 might therefore be taken at somewhere
between 250,000 and 254,000 men,[<a id="chap0402fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn1">1</a>] of whom half
were permanently out of this country, while from
25,000 to 50,000 could not be reckoned on as
available in case of war, for the reason that they were
either recent recruits or 'immatures.'[<a id="chap0402fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P318"></a>318}</span>
</p>

<p>
The reserves and additional troops which would
be called out in the event of a serious war were so
different in character that it was impossible simply
to throw them into a single total, and draw conclusions
therefrom according to the rules of arithmetic.  For
when people spoke of the <i>Army Reserve</i>, the <i>Special
Reserve</i>, and the <i>Territorial Army</i>, they were talking
of three things, the values of which were not at all
comparable.  The first were fully trained fighting
soldiers; the second were lads with a mere smattering
of their trade; while the third were little more
than an organised schedule of human material&mdash;mainly
excellent&mdash;which would become available for
training only at the outbreak of war, and whose
liability for service was limited to home defence.
The sum-total of these reserves and additional troops
was roughly 450,000 men; but this row of figures
was entirely meaningless, or else misleading, until
the significance of its various factors was grasped.[<a id="chap0402fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE THREE RESERVES
</span>
</p>

<p>
The first of these categories, the <i>Army Reserve</i>,
was the only one which could justly claim to rank
as a true reserve&mdash;that is, as a fighting force, from
the outbreak of war equal in calibre to the Continental
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P319"></a>319}</span>
troops against which, it would be called upon to
take the field.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Army Reserve</i> consisted of men who had
served their full time in the <i>Regular Army</i>.  They
were therefore thoroughly trained and disciplined,
needing only a few days&mdash;or at most weeks&mdash;to rub
the rust off them.[<a id="chap0402fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn4">4</a>]  Nominally their numbers were
137,000[<a id="chap0402fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn5">5</a>] men; but as over 8000 of these were living
out of the United Kingdom the net remainder had
to be taken at something under 130,000.  Moreover,
as the <i>Army Reserve</i> depended automatically upon
the strength of the <i>Regular Army</i>, and as the strength
of this had recently been reduced, it seemed
necessarily to follow that ultimately there would be a
considerable diminution.
</p>

<p>
The second category to which the name of a
reserve was given was the <i>Special Reserve</i>.  This,
however, was no true reserve like the first, for it was
wholly unfit to take the field upon the outbreak of
hostilities.  It was the modern substitute for the
Militia, and was under obligation to serve abroad in
time of war.  The term of enlistment was six years,
and the training nominally consisted of six months
in the first year, and one month in camp in each of
the succeeding years.  But in practice these
conditions had been greatly relaxed.  It was believed
that, upon the average, the term of training amounted
to even less than the proposals of the National Service
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P320"></a>320}</span>
League,[<a id="chap0402fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn6">6</a>] which had been criticised from the official
standpoint&mdash;severely and not altogether unjustly&mdash;on
the ground that they would not provide soldiers
fit to be drafted immediately into the fighting line.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the inadequacy of its military
education, this <i>Special Reserve</i> was relied upon in
some measure for making up the numbers of our
Expeditionary Force[<a id="chap0402fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn7">7</a>] at the commencement of war,
and individuals from it, and even in some cases units,
would therefore have been sent out to meet the
conscript armies of the Continent, to which they were
inferior, not only in length and thoroughness of
training, but also in age.  It was important also to
bear in mind that they would be led by comparatively
inexperienced and untrained officers.  The strength
of the <i>Special Reserve</i> was approximately 58,000[<a id="chap0402fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn8">8</a>]
men, or lads.  Under the most favourable view it
was a corps of apprentices whose previous service
had been of a very meagre and desultory character.
</p>

<p>
The third category was the <i>Territorial Army</i>,
whose term of service was four years and whose
military training, even nominally, only consisted of
fifteen days in camp each year, twenty drills the first
year, and ten drills each year after that.  In reality
this training had, on the average, consisted of very
much less.  This force was not liable for service
abroad, but only for home defence.
</p>

<p>
The minimum strength of the <i>Territorial Army</i>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P321"></a>321}</span>
was estimated beforehand by Lord Haldane at
316,000 men; but these numbers had never been
reached.  The approximate strength was only
260,000 men, of whom only about half had qualified,
both by doing fifteen days in camp, and by passing
an elementary test in musketry.[<a id="chap0402fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn9">9</a>]  These numbers had
recently shown a tendency to shrink rather than swell.[<a id="chap0402fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THEIR VALUES AND TRAINING
</span>
</p>

<p>
The value of the <i>Territorial Army</i>, therefore, was
that of excellent, though in certain cases immature,
material, available for training upon the outbreak
of war.  But in spite of its high and patriotic spirit
it was wholly unfit to take the field against trained
troops until it had undergone the necessary training.
</p>

<p>
In the event of war we could not safely reckon
upon being able to withdraw our garrisons from
abroad.[<a id="chap0402fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn11">11</a>]  Consequently, in the first instance, and
until the <i>Special Reserve</i> and the <i>Territorial Army</i>
had been made efficient, all we could reasonably
depend upon for serious military operations, either at
home or abroad, were that part of the <i>Regular Army</i>
which was in the United Kingdom, and the <i>Army
Reserve</i>.
</p>

<p>
In round figures therefore our soldiers immediately
available for a European war (<i>i.e.</i> that portion of
the <i>Regular Army</i> which was stationed at home and
the <i>Army Reserve</i>) amounted on mobilisation to
something much under 250,000 men.  Our apprentice
troops (the <i>Special Reserve</i>), who were really
considerably less than <i>half</i>-made, numbered something
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P322"></a>322}</span>
under 60,000 men.  Our <i>un</i>made raw material (the
<i>Territorial Army</i>), excellent in quality and
immediately available for training, might be taken at
260,000 men.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The main consideration arising out of this analysis
was of course the inadequacy of the British Army to
make good the numerical deficiency of the Triple
Entente in the Western theatre during the <i>onset</i> and
the <i>grip</i> of war.  Supposing England to be involved
in a European war, which ran its course and was
brought to a conclusion with the same swiftness
which had characterised every other European
war within the last half century, how were our
<i>half</i>-made and our <i>un</i>made troops to be rendered
efficient in time to effect the result in any way
whatsoever?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
SCARCITY OF OFFICERS
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was yet another consideration of great
gravity.  If our full Expeditionary Force were sent
abroad we should have to strain our resources to the
utmost to bring it up to its full nominal strength and
keep it there.  The wastage of war would necessarily
be very severe in the case of so small a force;
especially heavy in the matter of officers.  Consequently,
from the moment when this force set sail, there would
be a dearth of officers in the United Kingdom
competent to train the <i>Special Reserve</i>, the <i>Territorial
Army</i>, and the raw recruits.  Every regular and
reserve officer in the country would be required in
order to mobilise the Expeditionary Force, and keep
it up to its full strength during the first six months.
As things then stood there was a certainty&mdash;in case
of war&mdash;of a very serious shortage of officers of suitable
experience and age to undertake the duties, which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P323"></a>323}</span>
were required under our recently devised military
system.[<a id="chap0402fn12text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
Half-made soldiers and raw material alike would
therefore be left to the instruction of amateur or
hastily improvised officers&mdash;zealous and intelligent
men without a doubt; but unqualified, owing to their
own lack of experience, for training raw troops, so as
to place them rapidly on an equality with the armies
to which they would find themselves opposed.  What
the British system contemplated, was as if you were
to send away the headmaster, and the assistant-masters,
and the under-masters, leaving the school
in charge of pupil-teachers.
</p>

<p>
In no profession is the direct personal influence
of teaching and command more essential than in
the soldier's.  In none are good teachers and leaders
more able to shorten and make smooth the road to
confidence and efficiency.  Seeing that we had chosen
to depend so largely upon training our army after
war began, it might have been supposed, that at least
we should have taken care to provide ourselves with
a sufficient number of officers and non-commissioned
officers, under whose guidance the course of education
would be made as thorough and as short as possible.
This was not the case.  Indeed the reverse was the
case.  Instead of possessing a large number of officers
and non-commissioned officers, beyond those actually
required at the outbreak of war for the purpose of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P324"></a>324}</span>
starting with, and repairing the wastage in the
Expeditionary Force, we were actually faced, as
things then stood, with a serious initial shortage of
the officers required for this one purpose alone.
</p>

<p>
Lord Haldane in framing the army system which
is associated with his name chose to place his trust
in a small, highly-trained expeditionary force for
immediate purposes, to be supplemented at a later
date&mdash;if war were obliging enough to continue for so
long&mdash;by a new army of which the <i>Territorials</i> formed
the nucleus, and which would not begin its real
training until after the outbreak of hostilities.  Under
the most favourable view this plan was a great gamble;
for it assumed that in the war which was contemplated,
the <i>onset</i> and the <i>grip</i> periods would be passed
through without crushing disaster, and that England
would, in due course, have an opportunity of making
her great strength felt in the <i>drag</i>.  It will be said
that Lord Haldane's assumption has been justified
by recent events, and in a sense this is true; but by
what merest hair-breadth escape, by what sacrifices
on the part of our Allies, at what cost in British lives,
with what reproach to our national good name, we
have not yet had time fully to realise.
</p>

<p>
But crediting Lord Haldane's system, if we may,
with an assumption which has been proved correct,
we have reason to complain that he did not act boldly
on this assumption and make his scheme, such as it
was, complete and effective.  For remember, it was
contemplated that the great new army, which was
to defend the existence of the British Empire in the
final round of war, should be raised and trained upon
the voluntary principle&mdash;upon a wave of patriotic
enthusiasm&mdash;after war broke out.  This new army
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P325"></a>325}</span>
would have to be organised, clothed, equipped, armed,
and supplied with ammunition.  The 'voluntary
principle' did not apply to matters of this kind.  It
might therefore have been expected that stores
would be accumulated, and plans worked out upon
the strictest business principles, with philosophic
thoroughness, and in readiness for an emergency
which might occur at any moment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
WANT OF STORES AND PLANS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Moral considerations which precluded 'conscription'
did not, and could not, apply to inanimate
material of war, or to plans and schedules of army
corps and camps, or to a body of officers enlisted of
their own free will.  It may have been true that to
impose compulsory training would have offended
the consciences of free-born Britons; but it was
manifestly absurd to pretend that the accumulation
of adequate stores of artillery and small arms, of
shells and cartridges, of clothing and equipment,
could offend the most tender conscience&mdash;could
offend anything indeed except the desire of the
tax-payer to pay as few taxes as possible.
</p>

<p>
If the British nation chose to bank on the
assumption, that it would have the opportunity given
it of 'making good' during the <i>drag</i> of war, it should
have been made to understand what this entailed
in the matter of supplies; and most of all in reserve
of officers.  All existing forces should at least have
been armed with the most modern weapons.  There
should have been arms and equipment ready for the
recruits who would be required, and who were relied
upon to respond to a national emergency.  There
should have been ample stores of every kind,
including artillery, and artillery ammunition, for that
Expeditionary Force upon which, during the first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P326"></a>326}</span>
six months we had decided to risk our national
safety.
</p>

<p>
But, in fact, we were provided fully in none of
these respects.  And least of all were we provided in
the matter of officers.  There was no case of conscience
at stake; but only the question of a vote in the
House of Commons.  We could have increased our
establishment of officers by a vote; we could have
laid in stores of ammunition, of clothing, of equipment
by a vote.  But the vote was not asked for&mdash;it might
have been unpopular&mdash;and therefore Lord Haldane's
scheme&mdash;in its inception a gamble of the most
hazardous character&mdash;was reduced to a mere
make-believe, for the reason that its originator lacked
confidence to back his own 'fancy.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Looking back at the Agadir incident, it seemed
plain enough, from a soldier's point of view, that the
British Expeditionary Force was inadequate, in a
purely military sense, to redress the adverse balance
against the French, and beat back a German invasion.
The moral effect, however, of our assistance would
undoubtedly have been very great, in encouraging
France and Belgium by our comradeship in arms,
and in discouraging Germany, by making clear to
her the firmness of the Triple Entente.
</p>

<p>
But by the summer of 1914&mdash;three years later&mdash;this
position had undergone a serious change.  In
a purely military sense, the value of such aid as it had
been in our power to send three years earlier, was
greatly diminished.  The increase in the German
striking force over that of France, which had taken
effect since 1911, was considerably greater than the
total numbers of the army which we held prepared
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P327"></a>327}</span>
for foreign service.  This was fully understood
abroad; and the knowledge of it would obviously
diminish the moral as well as the material effect of
our co-operation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
COST OF FULL INSURANCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
In order that the combined forces of France and
England might have a reasonable chance of holding
their own[<a id="chap0402fn13text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn13">13</a>] against Germany, until Russian pressure
began to tell, the smallest army which we ought to
have been able to put in the field, and maintain there
for six months, was not less than twice that of the
existing Expeditionary Force.  From a soldier's point
of view 320,000 men instead of 160,000 was the very
minimum with which there might be a hope of
withstanding the German onset; and for the purpose of
bringing victory within sight it would have been
necessary to double the larger of these figures.  In
order to reach the end in view, Britain ought to have
possessed a striking force at least half as large as that
of France, in round figures between 600,000 and
750,000 men.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This was how the matter appeared in 1912, viewed
from the standpoint of a soldier who found himself
asked to provide a force sufficient, not for
conquest&mdash;not for the purpose of changing the map of Europe to
the advantage of the Triple Entente&mdash;but merely in
order to safeguard the independence of Belgium and
Holland, to prevent France from being crushed by
Germany,[<a id="chap0402fn14text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn14">14</a>] and to preserve the security of the British
Empire.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P328"></a>328}</span>
</p>

<p>
The political question which presented itself to
the minds of enquirers was this&mdash;If the British nation
were told frankly the whole truth about the
Army, would it not conceivably decide that
complete insurance was a better bargain than half
measures?  What force ought we to be prepared to
send to France during the first fortnight of war in
order to make it a moral certainty that Germany
would under no circumstances venture to attack
France?
</p>

<p>
To questions of this sort it is obviously impossible
to give certain and dogmatic answers.  There are
occasions when national feeling runs away with
policy and overbears considerations of military
prudence.  The effects of sudden panic, of a sense of
bitter injustice, of blind pride or overweening
confidence, are incalculable upon any mathematical basis.
But regarding the matter from the point of view of
the Kaiser's general staff, whose opinion is usually
assumed to be a determining factor in German
enterprises, a British Expeditionary Force,
amounting to something over 600,000 men, would have
been sufficient to prevent the occurrence of a
coolly calculated war.  And in the event of war
arising out of some uncontrollable popular impulse, a
British Army of this size would have been enough,
used with promptitude and under good leadership, to
secure the defeat of the aggressor.
</p>

<p>
An Expeditionary Force of 320,000 men would
mean fully trained reserves of something over 210,000
in order to make good the wastage of war during a
campaign of six months.  Similarly an Expeditionary
Force of 600,000 would mean reserves of 400,000.  In
the former case a total of 530,000 trained soldiers,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P329"></a>329}</span>
and in the latter a total of 1,000,000, would therefore
have been required.[<a id="chap0402fn15text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
Even the smaller of these proposed increases
in the Expeditionary Force would have meant
doubling the number of trained soldiers in the British
Army; the larger would have meant multiplying it
by four.  Under what system would it be possible
to achieve these results if public opinion should
decide that either of them was necessary to national
security?  The answer was as easy to give as the
thing itself seemed hard to carry out.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LIMITS OF VOLUNTARY ENLISTMENT
</span>
</p>

<p>
It had become clear a good deal earlier than the
year 1914 that the limit of voluntary enlistment,
under existing conditions, had already been reached
for the Regular as well as the <i>Territorial</i> Army.  If,
therefore, greater numbers were required they could
only be provided by some form of compulsory service.
There was no getting away from this hard fact which
lay at the very basis of the situation.
</p>

<p>
If security were the object of British policy, the
Expeditionary Force must be fully trained before
war broke out.  It would not serve the purpose for
which it was intended, if any part of it, or of its
reserves, needed to be taught their trade after war
began.  Thoroughness of training&mdash;which must under
ordinary circumstances[<a id="chap0402fn16text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn16">16</a>] be measured by length of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P330"></a>330}</span>
training&mdash;appeared to be a factor of vital importance.
Given anything like equality in equipment, generalship,
and position, men who had undergone a full two
years' course&mdash;like the conscript armies of the
Continent&mdash;ought to have no difficulty in defeating a
much larger force which had less discipline and
experience.
</p>

<p>
The lessons of the South African War were in
many ways very useful; but the praise lavishly, and
justly, given to volunteer battalions by Lord Roberts
and other distinguished commanders, needed to be
studied in the light of the circumstances, and these
were of a peculiar character.  For one thing our
antagonists, the Boers, were not trained troops,
and moreover, their policy to a large extent was to
weary us out, by declining decisive action and
engaging us in tedious pursuits.  Our volunteers,
for the most part, were picked men.  Although only
half-trained&mdash;perhaps in the majority of cases wholly
untrained&mdash;circumstances in this case permitted of
their being given the time necessary for gaining
experience in the field before being required to fight.
This was an entirely different state of affairs from
what might be looked for in a European war, in a
densely peopled country, covered with a close
network of roads and railways&mdash;a war in which great
masses of highly disciplined soldiers would be hurled
against one another systematically, upon a settled
plan, until at last superiority at one point or another
should succeed in breaking down resistance.  The
South African war and a European war were two
things not in the least comparable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE PEOPLE HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW
</span>
</p>

<p>
Before the nation could be expected to come to a
final decision with regard to the insurance premium
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P331"></a>331}</span>
which it was prepared to pay, it would require to be
fully informed upon a variety of subordinate points
of much importance.  Cost was a matter which could
not be put lightly on one side; our peculiar obligations
in regard to foreign garrisons was another; the
nature of our industrial system was a third; and
there were many besides.  But the main and
governing consideration, if we wished to retain our
independence as a nation, was&mdash;what provisions were
adequate to security?  The people wanted to know,
and had a right to know, the facts.  And in the end,
with all due regard for our governors, and for the
self-importance of political parties, it was not either
for ministers or partisans to decide this question on
behalf of the people; it was for the people, on full
and honest information, to decide it for themselves.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn1text">1</a>] These rough totals were approximately
the same in the autumn of
1912, and at the outbreak of war in July 1914.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn2text">2</a>] The exact number of men who could remain
in the units when mobilised
was difficult to assess, for the reason that
it varied considerably according
to the trooping season,
which begins in August and ends in February.
February was therefore the most
unfavourable month for comparison,
and it is probably not far from the truth
to say that at that date 50,000 men
out of our nominal home army were
unavailable in case of war.  Under
the extreme stress of circumstances,
it had recently been decided that boys
of nineteen might serve in Europe in the event of war,
so that a good many
'immatures' were now nominally
'mature.'  Only nominally, however,
for even a war minister could not alter
the course of nature by a stroke
of the pen.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn3text">3</a>] Without wearying the reader
too much with figures the German
strength may be briefly indicated.
That country has a population roughly
half as large again as our own (65 millions against 45).
The total of fully
trained men whom the German Government could mobilise at the
declaration of war was something over 4,500,000.
Of these some 2,400,000 composed the 'striking force';
the remaining 2,100,000 or thereabouts, the
reserve for making good wastage of war.
But in addition, Germany had
scheduled and inscribed in her Ersatz,
or recruiting reserve, and in the
Landsturm, fully 5,000,000 untrained
and partially trained men, with
ample equipment and military instructors
for them all.  A large proportion
of these would be enrolled on mobilisation,
and would undertake garrison
and other duties, for which they would be
fitted after a short period of
service, thus freeing all fully trained men
for service in the field.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn4text">4</a>] For purposes of immediate mobilisation,
however, Continental reservists are superior to our own,
because in the British Army they lose
touch with their regiments,
and in case of war will in many cases be serving
with officers and comrades whom
they know nothing about; whereas in
Germany (for example) they come up
for periods of training with the
regiments to which they belong.
Also, at the outset, the proportion of
reservists to serving soldiers will be much greater in our case.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn5"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn5text">5</a>] This was in 1912.
Their numbers appear to have increased somewhat.
In July 1914 they were something over 146,000.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn6"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn6text">6</a>] Viz. four months for infantry and six for cavalry.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn7"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn7text">7</a>] Twenty-seven battalions of the
Special Reserve were scheduled to go
out as complete units for duty on lines
of communication, etc.  The report
on recruiting for 1912 says that the great
majority of recruits for the Special
Reserve join between the ages of seventeen
and nineteen.  It is hardly necessary
to point out the folly of putting boys
of this age in a situation where
they will be peculiarly liable to disease.
Continental nations employ their
oldest classes of reserves for these duties.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn8"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn8text">8</a>] In July 1914 about 61,000.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn9"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn9text">9</a>] <i>I.e.</i> in the autumn of 1912.
They were, therefore, 56,000 short of
Lord Haldane's estimate.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn10"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn10text">10</a>] Latterly there was a slight improvement
in recruiting.  In July 1914
the numbers (including permanent staff)
were a little over 268,000&mdash;48,000
short of Lord Haldane's estimate.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn11"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn11text">11</a>] The fact that in certain cases we
did so withdraw our garrisons in
1914-1915 without disaster does not
invalidate this calculation.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn12"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn12text">12</a>] The experience of the past few months
makes this criticism appear
absurd&mdash;in its <i>under</i>statement.
But of course what was contemplated
in 1912-13 was not anything upon the
gigantic scale of our present
'New Army'; but only (a) the <i>Special Reserve</i>,
(b) the <i>Territorial Army</i>,
possibly doubled in numbers during
the first six months, and (c) fresh
recruits for the <i>Regular Army</i> upon
a very considerably enhanced scale.
But even for these purposes which were foreseen,
the provision of officers was
quite inadequate; so inadequate indeed
as to appear from the soldier's
point of view in the light of a parliamentary farce.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn13"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn13text">13</a>] <i>I.e.</i> of holding the Germans
at the French frontier and keeping them
out of Belgium should they attempt to invade that country.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn14"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn14text">14</a>] At the time these totals were
worked out the results appeared very
startling to the lay mind.
Recent experience, however, has proved that
the soldiers who worked them out were
right when they described them
as 'modest estimates.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn15"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn15text">15</a>] In this calculation the wastage of war
during the first six months has
been taken at two-thirds.
With the smaller force of 160,000 men, practically
the whole army would be in the fighting line
all the time, and the wastage
consequently would be heavier.
It could not wisely be assumed at less
than three-fourths for the same period.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0402fn16"></a>
[<a href="#chap0402fn16text">16</a>] Obviously the better and more
experienced the officers, the higher the
quality of the recruits,
and the keener their spirit, the more quickly the
desired result will be achieved.
The last two have been very potent factors
in the rapid education of our present
'New Army.'  In a time of abnormal
patriotic impulse, the length of time
required will be much shortened.  Since
August 1914 the lack of experienced officers
has been the great difficulty.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
LORD ROBERTS'S WARNINGS
</h3>

<p>
Lord Roberts addressed many meetings in favour
of National Service during the years which followed
his return from South Africa in 1905; but the first
of his speeches to arrest widespread popular
attention was delivered in the Free Trade Hall at
Manchester, on October 22, 1912.  A popular audience
filled the building to overflowing, listened with
respect, and appeared to accept his conclusions with
enthusiasm.  His words carried far beyond the walls
of the meeting-place, and caused something approaching
a sensation, or, as some thought, a scandal, in
political circles.
</p>

<p>
Of the commentators upon this speech the greater
part were Liberals, and these condemned his
utterances with unanimity in somewhat violent language.
Official Unionism was dubious, uncomfortable, and
disapproving: it remained for the most part dumb.
A few voices were raised from this quarter in open
reprobation; a few others proclaimed their independence
of party discipline and hastened to approve
his sentiments.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt of one thing&mdash;Lord Roberts's
speech had at last aroused public interest.  For
the first time during the National Service agitation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P333"></a>333}</span>
blood had been drawn.  This was mainly due to the
object-lesson in the consequences of military
unpreparedness, which the first Balkan War was just
then unfolding before the astonished eyes of Europe.
In addition, those people, who for a year past had
been puzzling their heads over the true meaning
of the Agadir crisis, had become impressed with
the urgent need for arriving at a clear decision
with regard to the adequacy of our national
defences.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NEED FOR NATIONAL SERVICE
</span>
</p>

<p>
The speech was a lucid and forcible statement
of the need for compulsory military training.  It
was interesting reading at the time it was delivered,
and in some respects it is even more interesting to-day.
It was compactly put together, not a thing of patches.
A man who read any part of it would read it all.
Yet in accordance with custom, controversy raged
around three isolated passages.
</p>

<p>
The <i>first</i> of these runs as follows: "In the year
1912, our German friends, I am well aware, do
not&mdash;at least in sensible circles&mdash;assert dogmatically
that a war with Great Britain will take place this
year or next; but in their heart of hearts they
know, every man of them, that&mdash;just as in 1866
and just as in 1870&mdash;war will take place the instant
the German forces by land and sea are, by their
superiority at every point, as certain of victory as
anything in human calculation can be made certain.
Germany strikes when Germany's hour has struck.
That is the time-honoured policy of her Foreign
Office.  That was the policy relentlessly pursued
by Bismarck and Moltke in 1866 and 1870.  It
has been her policy decade by decade since that
date.  It is her policy at the present hour."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P334"></a>334}</span>
</p>

<p>
The <i>second</i> passage followed upon the first:
"It is an excellent policy.  It is or should be the
policy of every nation prepared to play a great
part in history.  Under that policy Germany has,
within the last ten years, sprung, as at a bound,
from one of the weakest of naval powers to the
greatest naval power, save one, upon this globe."
</p>

<p>
The <i>third</i> passage came later: "Such, gentlemen,
is the origin, and such the considerations which
have fostered in me the growth of this conviction&mdash;the
conviction that in some form of National Service
is the only salvation of this Nation and this Empire.
The Territorial Force is now an acknowledged
failure&mdash;a failure in discipline, a failure in numbers,
a failure in equipment, a failure in energy."[<a id="chap0403fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
The accuracy of the <i>first</i> and <i>third</i> of these
statements now stands beyond need of proof.  It was
not truer that Germany would strike so soon as her
rulers were of opinion that the propitious hour had
struck, than it was that, when the British Government
came to take stock of their resources at the
outbreak of war, they would find the Territorial Army
to be lacking in the numbers, equipment, training,
and discipline, which alone could have fitted it for
its appointed task&mdash;the defence of our shores against
invasion.  Slowly, and under great difficulties, and
amid the gravest anxieties these defects had
subsequently to be made good, hampering the while our
military operations in the critical sphere.
</p>

<p>
The <i>second</i> statement was of a different character,
and taken by itself, without reference to the context,
lent itself readily to misconception as well as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P335"></a>335}</span>
misconstruction.  A certain number of critics, no doubt,
actually believed, a still larger number affected to
believe, that Lord Roberts was here advocating the
creation of a British army, for the purpose of attacking
Germany, without a shred of justification, and at
the first favourable moment.
</p>

<p>
The whole tenor of this speech, however, from
the first line to the last, made it abundantly clear
that in Lord Roberts's opinion Britain could have
neither motive nor object for attacking Germany;
that the sole concern of England and of the British
Empire with regard to Germany was, how we might
defend our possessions and secure ourselves against
her schemes of aggression.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
POINTS OF CRITICISM
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lord Roberts, however, had in fact pronounced
the intentions which he attributed to Germany to
be 'an excellent policy,' and had thereby seemed
to approve, and recommend for imitation, a system
which was revolting to the conscience of a Christian
community.
</p>

<p>
The idea that Lord Roberts could have had any
such thoughts in his mind seemed merely absurd to
any one who knew him; nay, it must also have
seemed inconceivable to any one who had taken
the trouble to read the speech itself in an
unprejudiced mood.  To an ordinary man of sense it
did not need Lord Roberts's subsequent letter of
explanation[<a id="chap0403fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn2">2</a>] to set his opinions in their true light.
It was clear that his object, in this 'peccant
passage,' had merely been to avoid a pharisaical
condemnation of German methods and ambitions,
and to treat that country as a worthy, as well as a
formidable, antagonist.  Being a soldier,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P336"></a>336}</span>
however,&mdash;not a practised platform orator alive to the dangers
of too-generous concession&mdash;he went too far.  The
words were unfortunately chosen, seeing that so
many critics were on the watch, not to discover the
true meaning of the speech, but to pounce on any
slip which might be turned to the disadvantage of
the speaker.
</p>

<p>
At first there was an attempt on the part of certain
London[<a id="chap0403fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn3">3</a>] Liberal journals to boycott this speech.
Very speedily, however, it seemed to dawn upon
them that they had greater advantages to gain by
denouncing it.  A few days later, accordingly, the
torrent of condemnation was running free.  The
ablest attack appeared in the <i>Nation</i>,[<a id="chap0403fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn4">4</a>] and as this
pronouncement by the leading Radical weekly was
quoted with approval by the greater part of the
ministerial press throughout the country, it may
fairly be taken as representing the general view
of the party.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A RADICAL ATTACK
</span>
</p>

<p>
The article was headed <i>A Diabolical Speech</i>,
and its contents fulfilled the promise of the title.
"There ought," said the writer, "to be some means
of bringing to book a soldier, in the receipt of
money from the State, who speaks of a friendly
Power as Lord Roberts spoke of Germany."  He
was accused roundly of predicting and encouraging
a vast and 'hideous conflict' between the
two countries.  Lord Roberts was a 'successful'[<a id="chap0403fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn5">5</a>]
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P337"></a>337}</span>
soldier; but 'without training in statesmanship.'  He
'had never shown any gift for it.'  His was
'an average Tory intellect.'  He was a 'complete
contrast to Wellington, who possessed two great
qualities; for "he set a high value on peace, and
he knew how to estimate and bow to the governing
forces of national policy....  Lord Roberts
possesses neither of these attributes.  He is a mere
jingo in opinion and character, and he interprets
the life and interests of this nation and this Empire
by the crude lusts and fears which haunt the
unimaginative soldier's brain."
</p>

<p>
We may pause at this breathing-place to take
note of the healing influences of time.  Radical
journalists of 1832, and thereabouts, were wont to
say very much the same hard things of the Duke
of Wellington, as those of 1912 saw fit to apply to
Earl Roberts....  We may also remark in passing,
upon the errors to which even the most brilliant
of contemporary judgments are liable.  There has
never been a man in our time who set a higher value
on peace than Lord Roberts did.  He realised,
however, not only the intrinsic value of peace, but
its market cost.  His real crime, in the eyes of pacifists,
was that he stated publicly, as often as he had the
chance, what price we must be prepared to pay, if
we wanted peace and not war.  It was in this sense,
no doubt, that he did not know 'how to estimate and
bow to the governing forces of national policy.'  His
blunt warnings broke in rudely and crudely upon the
comfortable discourse of the three counsellors&mdash;<i>Simple</i>,
<i>Sloth</i>, and <i>Presumption</i>, who, better than any others,
were skilled in estimating the 'governing forces,' and
the advantages to be gained by bowing to them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P338"></a>338}</span>
</p>

<p>
The writer in the <i>Nation</i> then proceeded to riddle
Lord Roberts's theories of defence.  "He desires
us to remain a 'free nation' in the same breath
that he invites us to come under the yoke of
conscription"&mdash;intolerable, indeed, that the citizens
of a free nation should be ordered to fit themselves
for defending their common freedom&mdash;"conscription,
if you please, for the unheard-of purpose of overseas
service in India and elsewhere...."  This invitation
does not seem to be contained in this, or any
other of Lord Roberts's speeches; but supposing it to
have been given, it was not altogether 'unheard-of,'
seeing that, under the law of conscription prevalent
(for example) in Germany, conscript soldiers can be
sent to Palestine, or tropical Africa as lawfully as into
Luxemburg, Poland, or France.  According to the
<i>Nation</i>, the true theory of defence was Sea Power;
but this, it appeared, could not be relied on for all
time....  "While our naval monopoly&mdash;like our
commercial monopoly&mdash;cannot exist for ever, our
sea power and our national security depend on our
ability to crush an enemy's fleet....  We were never
so amply insured&mdash;so over-insured&mdash;against naval
disaster as we are to-day."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A LIBERAL ATTACK
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Lord Roberts's proposition, therefore," the writer
continued, "is merely foolish; it is his way of
commending it, which is merely wicked.  He speaks
of war as certain to take place 'the instant' the
German forces are assured of 'superiority at every
point,' and he discovers that the motto of German
foreign policy is that <i>Germany strikes when Germany's
hour has struck</i>.  Germany does not happen to
have struck anybody since 1870, and she struck
then to secure national unity, and to put an end to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P339"></a>339}</span>
the standing menace of French imperialism.  Since
then she has remained the most peaceful and the
most self-contained, though doubtless not the most
sympathetic, member of the European family....
Germany, the target of every cheap dealer in historic
slapdash, is in substance the Germany of 1870"
(<i>i.e.</i> in extent of territory), "with a great industrial
dominion superadded by the force of science and
commercial enterprise.  That is the story across
which Lord Roberts scrawls his ignorant libel....
By direct implication he invites us to do to Germany
what he falsely asserts she is preparing to do to
us.  These are the morals, fitter for a wolf-pack
than for a society of Christian men, commended
as 'excellent policy' to the British nation in the
presence of a Bishop of the Anglican Church."
</p>

<p>
This was very vigorous writing; nor was there
the slightest reason to suspect its sincerity.  In the
nature of man there is a craving to believe; and if
a man happens to have his dwelling-place in a world
of illusion and unreality, it is not wonderful that he
should believe in phantoms.  The credulity of the
<i>Nation</i> might appear to many people to amount
to fanaticism; but its views were fully shared, though
less tersely stated, by the whole Liberal party,
by the greater proportion of the British people,
and not inconceivably by the bulk of the Unionist
opposition as well.  The Government alone, who had
learned the true facts from Lord Haldane eight
months earlier, knew how near Lord Roberts's
warnings came to the mark.
</p>

<p>
This article set the tone of criticism.  The
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> protested against the "insinuation
that the German Government's views of international
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P340"></a>340}</span>
policy are less scrupulous and more cynical than
those of other Governments."  Germany has never
been accused with justice "of breaking her word,
of disloyalty to her engagements, or of insincerity.
Prussia's character among nations is, in fact, not
very different from the character which Lancashire
men give to themselves as compared with other
Englishmen.  It is blunt, straightforward, and
unsentimental...."  How foolish, moreover, are
our fears of Germany when we come to analyse them.
"We have no territory that she could take, except,
in tropical Africa, which no sane man would go to
war about.  Our self-governing colonies could not
in any case be held by force; and Canada is
protected in addition by the Monroe doctrine.  Egypt
is not ours to cede.  Malta could not be had
without war with Italy nor India without war with
Russia."[<a id="chap0403fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
This was a proud statement of the basis of British
security, and one which must have warmed the
hearts, and made the blood of Cromwell and Chatham
tingle in the shades.  Egypt, which we had rescued
from a chaos of civil war, bankruptcy, and corruption,
which during more than thirty years we had administered
as just stewards for the benefit of her people,
which we had saved from conquest and absorption
by savage hordes&mdash;Egypt was not ours to cede.
For the rest our dependencies were not worth taking
from us, while our 'colonies' could defend themselves.
By the grace of Italy's protection we should be
secured in the possession of Malta.  India would
be preserved to us by the goodwill of Russia, and
Canada by the strong arm of the United States....
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P341"></a>341}</span>
Such at that time were the views of the Liberal
journal foremost in character and ability.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A UNIONIST ATTACK
</span>
</p>

<p>
Somewhat later the <i>Daily News</i> took the field,
making up for lost time by an exuberance of
misconstruction....  "The whole movement as
represented by the National Service League is definitely
unmasked as an attempt to get up, not defence, but
an invasion of German territory.  This discovery,
which for years has been suspected, is most valuable
as showing up the real object of the League, with its
glib talk about military calisthenics.  Lord Roberts
may have been indiscreet, but at least he has
made it clear that what the League wants is war."[<a id="chap0403fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
On the same day, in order that the Liberals
might not have a monopoly of reprobation, the
<i>Evening Standard</i>, in an article entitled <i>A Word
with Lord Roberts</i>, rated him soundly for having
"made an attack upon Germany and an attack
upon the Territorial Force...."  "It is mere
wanton mischief-making for a man with Lord
Roberts's unequalled prestige to use words which
must drive every German who reads them to
exasperation."  And yet no signs whatsoever were
forthcoming that so much as a single Teuton had
been rendered desperate, or had taken the words
as in the least degree uncomplimentary.  Up to the
day of his death&mdash;and indeed after his death[<a id="chap0403fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn8">8</a>]&mdash;Lord
Roberts was almost the only Englishman of
his time of whom Germans spoke with consistent
respect....  "Do not," continues this lofty and
sapient mentor, "Do not let us talk as if the Kaiser
could play the part of a Genghis Khan or an Attila,
ravening round the world at the head of armed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P342"></a>342}</span>
hordes to devour empires and kingdoms."[<a id="chap0403fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn9">9</a>]  And
yet how otherwise has the whole British Press been
talking ever since the middle of August 1914?  If
during this period of nine months, the <i>Evening
Standard</i> has kept all reference to Attila and his
Huns out of its columns, its continence is unique.
</p>

<p>
It would serve no useful purpose to set out further
items of criticism and abuse from the leader and
correspondence columns of newspapers, or from the
speeches of shocked politicians.  The <i>Nation</i>, the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i>, and the <i>Daily News</i> are entitled,
between them, to speak for the Liberal party; and
if it cannot be said that the <i>Evening Standard</i> is
quite similarly qualified in respect of the Unionists,
there is still no doubt that the views which it expressed
with so much vigour, prescience, and felicity were
held by many orthodox members of its party.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Bromley-Davenport, for example, who
had been Financial Secretary to the War Office in the
late Unionist Government, spoke out strongly against
Lord Roberts's comments upon the efficiency of the
Territorial Force.  'Compulsory service,' in his
opinion, 'was not necessary....'  And then, with
a burst of illuminating candour&mdash;"Which of the
great parties in the state would take up compulsory
service and fight a general election upon it?  The
answer was that neither of the parties would;
and to ask for compulsory military service was
like crying for the moon."[<a id="chap0403fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn10">10</a>]  The power of any
proposal for winning elections was to be the touchstone
of its truth.  It would be impossible to state more
concisely the attitude of the orthodox politician.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P343"></a>343}</span>
Which party, indeed, we may well ask, would have
fought a general election on anything, however
needful, unless it hoped to win on it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MINISTERIAL ATTACKS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The attitude of Ministers, however, with regard
to Lord Roberts's speech is much more worthy of
remark than that of independent journalists and
members of Parliament.  For the Government knew
several very important things which, at that time,
were still hidden from the eyes of ordinary men.
</p>

<p>
It was eight months since Lord Haldane had
returned from Germany, concealing, under a smiling
countenance and insouciant manner, a great burden of
care at his heart.  If on his return he spoke cheerily
on public platforms about the kindness of his
entertainment at Berlin, and of the greatness and goodness
of those with whom he had there walked and talked,
this was merely in order that his fellow-countrymen
might not be plunged in panic or despondency.  He
had learned the mind of Germany, and it was no
light lesson.  He had imparted his dreadful secret
to his colleagues, and we have learned lately from
Mr. Asquith himself what that secret was....  The
rulers of Germany, 'to put it quite plainly,' had
asked us for a free hand to overbear and dominate
the European world, whenever they deemed the
opportunity favourable.  They had demanded this
of the astounded British emissary, "at a time when
Germany was enormously increasing both her
aggressive and defensive resources, and especially
upon the sea."  To such a demand but one answer
was possible, and that answer the British Government
had promptly given&mdash;so we are led to infer&mdash;in clear
and ringing tones of scorn.[<a id="chap0403fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P344"></a>344}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Government knew for certain what nobody
else did.  They knew what the aims of Germany
were, and consequently they knew that Lord Roberts
had spoken nothing but the truth.
</p>

<p>
And yet, strange to relate, within a few days we
find Mr. Runciman, a member of the Cabinet,
administering a severe castigation to Lord Roberts.  The
Manchester speech was "not only deplorable and
pernicious,' but likewise 'dangerous.'  If it was
resented in Germany, Mr. Runciman 'would like
Germany to know that it is resented no less in
England...."  Lord Roberts had been a great
organiser of the National Service League, the object
of which was 'practically conscription'; but "he
knows little of England, and certainly little of the
North of England, if he imagines we are ever likely
to submit to conscription"&mdash;not even apparently
(for there are no reservations) as an alternative to
conquest; or as a security against murder, arson,
and rape....  "War is only inevitable when statesmen
cannot find a way round, or through, difficulties
that may arise; or are so wicked that they prefer
the hellish method of war to any other method of
solution; or are so weak as to allow soldiers,
armament makers, or scaremongers to direct their
policy."[<a id="chap0403fn12text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn12">12</a>]  Lord Roberts was not, of course, an
armament maker, but he was a scaremonger and a
soldier, and as such had no right to state his views
as to how peace might be kept.
</p>

<p>
When Sir Edward Grey was asked if any
representation had been addressed by Germany to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P345"></a>345}</span>
Foreign Office with reference to Lord Roberts's
utterances, he deprecated, with frigid discretion, the
idea that either Government should make official
representation to the other about 'unwise or
provocative speeches.'[<a id="chap0403fn13text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn13">13</a>]  When Sir William Byles
plied the Secretary of State for War, Colonel Seely,
with questions as to the revocability of Lord Roberts's
pension, the answer was solemn and oracular, but
no rebuke was administered to the interrogator.[<a id="chap0403fn14text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MR. ACLAND'S PERSISTENCY
</span>
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the most puzzling thing of all, is the
persistency with which Mr. Acland (Sir Edward Grey's
Under-Secretary) pursued Lord Roberts for some
three weeks after the rest were finished with him.
It might have been expected that Mr. Acland's chief,
who knew 'the dreadful secret,' would have curbed
his subordinate's excess of zeal.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Acland distorted the Manchester speech into
an appeal to the British people to put themselves
"in a position to strike at the Germans, and to
smash them in a time of profound peace, and without
cause."  And this fanciful gloss he rightly denounces,
in accents which remind us not a little of the Reverend
Robert Spalding, as 'nothing less than a wicked
proposal.'[<a id="chap0403fn15text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn15">15</a>] ... For England to adopt compulsory
military service would be "an utterly criminal and
provocative proceeding against other countries of the
world...."  Here, indeed, is much food for wonder.
What single country of the world would have regarded
the adoption of national service by England as
'provocative'?  What single country, except
Germany, would even have objected to it?  And
what more right would Germany have had to object
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P346"></a>346}</span>
to our possessing a formidable army, than we had
right to object to her possessing a formidable
navy?
</p>

<p>
When some days later Mr. Acland is reproached
with having misrepresented Lord Roberts's original
statement, he replies loftily that he "was justified
at the time in supposing that this was his real
meaning."[<a id="chap0403fn16text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn16">16</a>]  One wonders why.  Lord Roberts had
said nothing which any careful reader of his whole
speech&mdash;an Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, for
example, quoting and speaking with a due sense
of his great responsibilities&mdash;could conceivably have
understood to bear this interpretation.
</p>

<p>
A fortnight later Mr. Acland returns to the charge
once more.  "Lord Roberts," he says courteously,
"has since explained that he did not mean what
his words seemed so plainly to mean"&mdash;that is,
the smashing of Germany in time of profound peace
and without any cause....  Danger to peace, the
representative of the Foreign Office assures his
audience, "does not come from any action of His
Majesty's Government.  It arises, if at all, from
irresponsible utterances such as those which we
heard from Lord Roberts.  I very much regret
that harm must have been done between the two
countries by Lord Roberts's speech."[<a id="chap0403fn17text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn17">17</a>]
</p>

<p>
Although an under-secretary does not always
enjoy the full confidence of his official superior,
he would presumably obey orders&mdash;even an order to
hold his tongue&mdash;if any were given.  Consequently,
although Lord Haldane's dreadful secret may have
been kept from Mr. Acland, as unfit for his innocent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P347"></a>347}</span>
and youthful ears, it is surprising that he was never
warned of the dangers of the path in which he was
so boldly treading.  The discourtesies of youth to
age are not easily forgiven, especially where they are
founded upon misrepresentation, and when, as in
this case, the older man was right and the younger
wrong as to the facts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LORD ROBERTS WAS RIGHT
</span>
</p>

<p>
It will be said&mdash;it has indeed been already said&mdash;by
way of excuse for the reticence of the Government
with regard to the intentions, which German statesmen
revealed to Lord Haldane, at Berlin, in February
1912&mdash;that by keeping back from the country the
knowledge which members of the Cabinet possessed,
they thereby prevented an outbreak of passion and
panic which might have precipitated war.  This
may be true or untrue; it can neither be proved
nor controverted; but at any rate it was not in
accordance with the principle of trusting the people;
nor would it have prevented the Government and
their supporters&mdash;when war broke out&mdash;from making
amends to Lord Roberts and others whom, on grounds
of high policy, they had felt themselves obliged, in
the past to rebuke unjustly and to discredit without
warrant in the facts.  This course was not impossible.
Peel, a very proud man, made amends to Cobden,
and his memory does not stand any the lower for it.
</p>

<p>
With regard to those journalists and private
politicians whose mistakes were not altogether their
own fault&mdash;being due in part at least, to the
concealment of the true facts which the Government had
practised&mdash;it would not have been in the least wounding
to their honour to express regret, that they had
been unwittingly the means of misleading the people,
and traducing those who were endeavouring to lead
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P348"></a>348}</span>
it right.  In their patriotic indignation some of
these same journalists and politicians had
overstepped the limits of what is justifiable in party
polemics.  They had attacked the teaching at the
Military Colleges, because it sought to face the
European situation frankly, and to work out in the
lecture-room the strategical and tactical consequences
which, in case of war, might be forced upon us by our
relations with France and Russia.  It would have
done these high-minded journalists no harm in the
eyes of their fellow-countrymen, had they
acknowledged frankly that when in former days they had
denounced the words of Lord Roberts as 'wicked'
and his interpretation of the situation as inspired
by "the crude lusts and fears which haunt the
unimaginative soldier's brain"&mdash;when they had
publicly denounced as 'a Staff College Cabal' teachers
who were only doing their duty&mdash;they had unwittingly
been guilty of a cruel misjudgment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
FAILURE TO MAKE AMENDS
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is not a little remarkable that in 1912&mdash;indeed
from 1905 to 1914&mdash;Lord Roberts, who, according
to the Nation, possessed but 'an average Tory
intellect,' should have trusted the people, while a
democratic Government could not bring itself to
do so.  The Cabinet, which knew the full measure
of the danger, concealed it out of a mistaken notion
of policy.  Their henchmen on the platform and in
the press did not know the full measure of the danger.
They acted either from natural prejudice, or official
inspiration&mdash;possibly from a mixture of both&mdash;when
they made light of the danger and held up to scorn
any one who called attention to it.  The whole body
of respectable, word-worshipping, well-to-do Liberals
and Conservatives, whom nothing could stir out of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P349"></a>349}</span>
their indifference and scepticism, disapproved most
strongly of having the word 'danger' so much as
mentioned in their presence.  The country would
to-day forgive all of these their past errors more
easily if, when the crisis came, they had acted a
manly part and had expressed regret.  But never a
word of the sort from any of these great public
characters!

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
LORD KITCHENER'S TASK
</h3>

<p>
Lord Roberts had been seeking for seven years to
persuade the nation to realise that it was threatened
by a great danger; that it was unprepared to encounter
the danger; that by reason of this unpreparedness,
the danger was brought much nearer.  Until October
1912, however, he had failed signally in capturing
the public ear.  The people would not give him
their attention either from favour or indignation.
The cause of which he was the advocate appeared
to have been caught in an academic backwater.
</p>

<p>
But from that time forward, Lord Roberts had
no reason to complain of popular neglect.  Overcoming
his natural disinclination to platform oratory
and political agitation, sacrificing his leisure, putting
a dangerous strain upon his physical strength, he
continued his propaganda at a series of great meetings
in the industrial centres.  Everywhere he was listened
to with respect, and apparently with a great measure
of agreement.  Only on one occasion was he treated
with discourtesy, and that was by a civic dignitary
and not by the audience.  But he had now become
an important figure in the political conflict, and he
had to take the consequences, in a stream of abuse
and misrepresentation from the party which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P351"></a>351}</span>
disapproved of his principles; while he received but
little comfort from the other party, which lived in
constant terror lest it might be thought to approve
of them.  Lord Roberts's advocacy of national
service continued up to the autumn of 1913, when
the gravity of the situation in Ireland made it
impossible to focus public interest on any other subject.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
TRIUMPH OF VOLUNTARY SYSTEM
</span>
</p>

<p>
After the present war had run its course for a
month or two, the minds of many people reverted
to what Lord Roberts had been urging upon his
fellow-countrymen for nine years past.  His warnings
had come true; that at any rate was beyond doubt.
The intentions which he had attributed to Germany
were clearly demonstrated, and likewise the vastness
and efficiency of her military organisation.  The
inadequacy of British preparations was made plain.
They were inadequate in the sense that they had
failed to deter the aggressor from a breach of the
peace, and they had been equally inadequate for
withstanding his <i>onset</i>.  The deficiencies of the
Territorial Army in numbers, discipline, training,
and equipment had made it impossible to entrust
it with the responsibility of Home Defence
immediately upon the outbreak of war.  As a consequence
of this, the whole of the Regular Army could
not be released for foreign service, although Sir John
French's need of reinforcements was desperate.
Notwithstanding, however, that Lord Roberts's
warnings had come true, many people professed to
discover in what had happened a full justification&mdash;some
even went so far as to call it a 'triumph'&mdash;for
the voluntary system.
</p>

<p>
Even after the first battle of Ypres, those who
held such views had no difficulty in finding evidences
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P352"></a>352}</span>
of their truth on all hands.  They found them in
the conduct of our army in France, and in the courage
and devotion with which it had upheld the honour
of England against overwhelming odds.  They found
it in the response to Lord Kitchener's call for
volunteers, and in the eagerness and spirit of the New
Army.  They found it in our command of the sea,
in the spirit of the nation, and in what they read in
their newspapers about the approval and admiration
of the world.
</p>

<p>
In the short dark days of December and January
we were cheered by many bold bills and headlines
announcing what purported to be victories; and
we were comforted through a sad Christmastide by
panegyrics on British instinct, pluck, good-temper,
energy, and genius for muddling through.  Philosophic
commentators pointed out that, just as
Germany was becoming tired out and short of ammunition,
just as she was bringing up troops of worse and
worse quality, we should be at our very best, wallowing
in our resources of men and material of war.  Six
months, a year, eighteen months hence&mdash;for the
estimates varied&mdash;Britain would be invincible.
Economic commentators on the other hand impressed
upon us how much better it was to pay through the
nose now, than to have been bleeding ourselves
white as the Germans, the French, and the Russians
were supposed (though without much justification)
to have been doing for a century.
</p>

<p>
To clinch the triumph of the voluntary system&mdash;when
the Hour came the Man came with it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LORD KITCHENER'S APPOINTMENT
</span>
</p>

<p>
Many of these things were truly alleged.  Lord
Kitchener at any rate was no mirage.  The gallantry
of our Army was no illusion; indeed, its heroism
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P353"></a>353}</span>
was actually underrated, for the reason that the
extent of its peril had never been fully grasped.
Although British commerce had suffered severely
from the efforts of a few bold raiders, the achievements
of our Navy were such that they could quite
fairly be described, as having secured command of
the sea.[<a id="chap0404fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn1">1</a>]  The German fleet was held pretty closely
within its harbours.  We had been able to move
our troops and munitions of war wherever we pleased,
and so far, without the loss of a ship, or even of a
man.  Submarine piracy&mdash;a policy of desperation&mdash;had
not then begun.  The quality of the New Army,
the rapidity with which its recruits were being
turned into soldiers, not only impressed the public,
but took by complete surprise the severest of military
critics.
</p>

<p>
This is not the place for discussing how Lord
Kitchener came to be appointed Secretary of State
for War, or to attempt an estimate of his character
and career.[<a id="chap0404fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn2">2</a>]  He was no politician, but a soldier
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P354"></a>354}</span>
and an administrator.  He was in his sixty-fifth
year, and since he had left the Royal Military Academy
in 1871, by far the greater part of his work had been
done abroad&mdash;in the Levant, Egypt, South Africa,
and India.[<a id="chap0404fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn3">3</a>]  In no case had he ever failed at anything
he had undertaken.  The greater part of his work
had been completely successful; much of it had been
brilliantly successful.  He believed in himself; the
country believed in him; foreign nations believed
in him.  No appointment could have produced a
better effect upon the hearts of the British people
and upon those of their Allies.  The nation felt&mdash;if
we may use so homely an image in this connection&mdash;that
Lord Kitchener was holding its hand confidently
and reassuringly in one of his, while with the other
he had the whole race of politicians firmly by the
scruff, and would see to it that there was no nonsense
or trouble in that quarter.
</p>

<p>
It is no exaggeration to say that from that time
to this,[<a id="chap0404fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn4">4</a>] Lord Kitchener's presence in the Cabinet
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P355"></a>355}</span>
has counted for more with the country, than that
of any other minister, or indeed than all other
ministers put together.  That in itself proves his
possession of very remarkable qualities; for nine
such months of public anxiety and private sorrow,
as England has lately known, will disturb any reputation
which is not firmly founded upon merit.  During
this time we have seen other reputations come and
go; popularities made, and unmade, and remade.
We have seen great figures all but vanish into the
mist of neglect.  But confidence in Lord Kitchener
has remained constant through it all.  Things may
have gone wrong; the Government may have made
mistakes; even the War Office itself may have
made mistakes; yet the faith of the British people
in the man of their choice has never been shaken
for an instant.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
HIS GRASP OF ESSENTIALS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The highest of all Lord Kitchener's merits is, that
being suddenly pitchforked into office by an emergency,
he nevertheless grasped at once the two or three
main features of the situation, and turned the whole
force of his character to dealing with them, letting
the smaller matters meanwhile fall into line as best
they might.  He grasped the dominating factor&mdash;that
it was essential to subordinate every military
and political consideration to supporting France,
whose fight for her own existence was equally a
fight for the existence of the British Empire.  He
grasped the urgent need for the enrolment of many
hundreds of thousands of men fit for making into
soldiers, if we were to win this fight and not lose it.
He grasped the need for turning these recruits into
soldiers at a pace which hardly a single military
expert believed to be possible.  He may, or may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P356"></a>356}</span>
not, have fully grasped at the beginning, the difficulties&mdash;mainly
owing to dearth of officers&mdash;with which he
was faced: but when he did grasp them, by some
means or another, he succeeded in overcoming them.
</p>

<p>
It is dangerous to speak of current events in
confident superlatives; but one is tempted to do
so with regard to the training of the New Army.
Even the most friendly among expert critics believed
that what Lord Kitchener had undertaken was a thing
quite impossible to do in the prescribed time.  Yet he
has done it.  And not only the friendly, but also the
severest critics, have admitted that the New Army
is already fit to face any continental army, and that,
moreover, to all appearance, it is one of the finest
armies in history.  The sternest proof is yet to
come; but it is clear that something not far short
of a miracle has been accomplished.
</p>

<p>
If we search for an explanation of the miracle,
we find it quite as much in Lord Kitchener's character
as in his methods.  Fortunately what was so painfully
lacking in the political sphere was present in
the military&mdash;Leadership.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
HIS DISADVANTAGES
</span>
</p>

<p>
Despite the support which Lord Kitchener derived
from the public confidence he laboured under several
very serious disadvantages.  A man cannot spend
almost the whole of his working life out of England,
and then return to it at the age of sixty-four,
understanding all the conditions as clearly as if he had
never left it.  Lord Kitchener was ignorant not
only of English political conditions, but also of English
industrial conditions, which in a struggle like the
present are certainly quite as important as the
other.  He may well have consoled himself, however,
with the reflection that, although he himself was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P357"></a>357}</span>
lacking in knowledge, his colleagues were experts
in both of these spheres.
</p>

<p>
It was inevitable that Lord Kitchener must
submit to the guidance of Ministers in the political
sphere, providing they agreed with his main objects&mdash;the
unflinching support of France, and the creation
of the New Army.
</p>

<p>
In the industrial sphere, on the other hand, it
was the business of Ministers, not merely to keep
themselves in touch with Lord Kitchener's present
and future needs, and to offer their advice and help
for satisfying them, but also to insist upon his listening
to reason, if in his urgent need and unfamiliarity
with the business world, he was seen to be running
upon danger in any direction.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to resist the impression that,
while his colleagues held Lord Kitchener very close
by the head as to politics, and explained to him
very clearly what they conceived the people would
stand and would not stand, they did not show
anything like the same vigilance or determination in
keeping him well advised as to the means of procuring
the material of war.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0404fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0404fn1text">1</a>] Partly by good fortune, but mainly owing
to the admirable promptitude
and skill with which our naval resources
were handled, the bulk of the
German fleet was imprisoned from the outset.
We did not experience
anything like the full effect
of our unpreparedness.  If Mr. Churchill had
not taken his decision on the day
following the delivery of the Austrian
ultimatum to Servia (July 24)
by postponing the demobilisation of the
Fleet&mdash;to the great scandal of his own party,
when the facts first became
known&mdash;there would have been a very different
tale to tell as regards the
fate of the British merchant service on the high seas.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0404fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0404fn2text">2</a>] Critics of the present Government,
such as the editor of the <i>National
Review</i>, have maintained that Lord Kitchener
was forced upon an unwilling
Cabinet by the pressure of public opinion;
that although he was in England
throughout the crisis he was allowed
to make all his preparations for returning to Egypt,
and was only fetched back as he was
on the point of stepping
aboard the packet; that the well-known form
of Lord Haldane had been
seen at the War Office, and that
if the Lord Chancellor had, as was intended,
relinquished his legal position in order
to become Secretary of State for War,
we should probably not have sent abroad
our Expeditionary Force.  It is
undeniable that during Sunday, Monday,
and Tuesday (August 2, 3, and 4)
London was buzzing with a strange rumour
(which was fathered altogether
falsely upon the French Ambassador)
that France did not ask for or require
our assistance on land; but only at sea.
If this were so the absurdity of
sending our Expeditionary Force
would have been obvious.  It is noteworthy that a usually
well-inspired section of the Ministerial Press&mdash;even
after they had reluctantly accepted war
as inevitable&mdash;were still maintaining
stoutly, even so late as Tuesday and
Wednesday (4th and 5th), that the
Expeditionary Force should not be allowed
to cross the channel.  Lord
Kitchener was appointed on the Thursday,
and the Expeditionary Force
began to go abroad the following week.
The chapter of English political
history which begins with the presentation
of the Austrian ultimatum to
Servia on the 23rd of July, and ends
with the appointment of Lord Kitchener
on the 6th of August, will no doubt prove
to be one of the most interesting
in our annals.  Whether it will prove
to be one of the most glorious or one
of the most humiliating exhibitions
of British statesmanship we cannot
say until we possess fuller knowledge
than we do at present of the attitude
of ministers at the Cabinets of Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday (July 31,
August 1 and 2).

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
MATERIAL OF WAR
</h3>

<p>
As regards the business world the position at this
time[<a id="chap0405fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0405fn1">1</a>] was a singularly difficult one.  Within a few
days of the outbreak of war, orders from all parts
of the globe were forthcoming, on so vast a scale
that the ordinary means of coping with them were
wholly inadequate.  It was not possible to walk out
of the War Office and buy what was wanted in the
shops.  In a very brief period the whole industrial
system of the United Kingdom was congested with
orders.
</p>

<p>
In Lord Kitchener's former experience of military
and civil administration the difficulty had usually
been to get the money he needed, in order to carry
out his reforms and undertakings.  But here was a
case where he could have all the money he chose to
ask for; it was the commodities themselves which
could not be had either for money or love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ORGANISATION OF RESOURCES
</span>
</p>

<p>
When war broke out the industries of France and
Belgium were paralysed&mdash;the former temporarily,
the latter permanently.  We could buy nothing in
France; France, on the other hand, was buying eagerly
in England.  And so was Russia, not herself as yet
a great industrial producer.  And so were Belgium,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P359"></a>359}</span>
Servia, Italy, Roumania, Greece, Japan&mdash;indeed the
whole world, more or less&mdash;belligerents and neutrals
alike&mdash;except the two Powers with which we were at
war.  All these competitors were in the field against
the War Office, running up prices, and making the
fortunes of enterprising middlemen, who flocked to
the feast, like vultures from all corners of the sky.
The industrial situation, therefore, needed the sternest
regulation, and needed it at once.  For it was essential
to secure our own requirements, and to make certain
that our Allies secured theirs, at a fair price and in
advance of all other purchasers.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, it was obviously necessary to look an
immense way ahead, especially as regards munitions
of war; to aid with loans, and encourage with orders,
firms able and willing to make what was required.
It was essential that makers of arms and supplies
should be stimulated to undertake vast increases of
their staff and plant.  Before the battle of the Marne
was ended it was known, only too well, that every
nation in Europe&mdash;with the single exception of
Germany&mdash;had grossly underestimated the expenditure
of artillery ammunition under conditions of
modern warfare.  It was of the most immediate
urgency to concert with our Allies, and with our
manufacturers, in order to set this trouble right.  It
was as necessary for the Allies to organise their
resources as it was for them to organise their armies.
The second, indeed, was impossible without the first,
as Germany well knew, and in her own case had
already practised.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there was the problem&mdash;half industrial,
half political&mdash;of labour; its hours, conditions, and
remuneration.  Without the utmost vigilance and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P360"></a>360}</span>
sympathy, without a constant inspiration of duty,
without political leadership which appealed to the
imagination and heart of the people, there were bound
to be endless troubles and confusion; there were
bound to be disputes, quarrels, stoppages, and
strikes.
</p>

<p>
The prices of certain munitions and materials
were almost anything the makers liked to name.
Money was flying about, and everybody was aware
of it.  Human nature was sorely tempted.  The
future was anxious and uncertain.  People dependent
for a living on their own exertions, were beset with a
dangerous inclination to hold out their pitchers, in the
hopes of catching some portion of the golden shower
while it lasted.  The idea that workmen were, on
the average, any greedier than their masters is only
held by persons who have little knowledge of the
facts.  Cost of living had risen rapidly; this might
have been foreseen from the beginning, as well as
the dangers which it contained.
</p>

<p>
In such circumstances as these the baser appetites
of mankind are always apt to break loose and gain
the upper hand, unless there is a firm leadership of
the nation.  That is where the statesman should
come in, exercising a sagacious control upon the
whole organisation of industry; impressing on masters
the need for patience and sympathy; on their
men the need for moderation; on all the need for
sacrifices.
</p>

<p>
During the months of February, March, and
April 1915 there was a loud outcry, led by a member
of the Government, deploring the lack of munitions
of war, and attributing the deficiency to
a want of industry and energy on the part of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P361"></a>361}</span>
section of the working classes.  Their frequent
abstentions were condemned, and drunkenness was
alleged to have been, in many cases, a contributory
cause.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MINISTERIAL INCONSISTENCIES
</span>
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Asquith came forward and astonished
the world by denying stoutly that there was, or ever
had been, any deficiency in munitions of war.[<a id="chap0405fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0405fn2">2</a>]  He
assured the country that so long ago as September
he had "appointed a committee ... to survey the
situation."[<a id="chap0405fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0405fn3">3</a>]  He said nothing about irregularity of
work, or about drunkenness as a cause of it.  On
the contrary, he produced the impression that the
Army was as well provided as it could be, and that
the behaviour of the whole world of industry had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P362"></a>362}</span>
been as impeccable as the foresight and energy of
the Government.
</p>

<p>
The country found it difficult to reconcile these
various statements one with another.  It found it
still more difficult to reconcile Mr. Asquith's
assurances with what it had heard, not only from other
Ministers, but from generals in their published
communications.  Private letters from the front for
months past had told a very different story from
that which was told, in soothing tones, to the
Newcastle audience.  These had laid stress upon the
heavy price paid in casualties, and the heavy handicap
imposed on military operations, owing to shortage
of artillery ammunition.  The appointment of the
Committee alone was wholly credited; the rest of
these assurances were disbelieved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
COMPLAINTS ABOUT MUNITIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Indeed it was impossible to doubt that there had
been miscalculation and want of foresight in various
directions; and it would have been better to admit
it frankly.  The blame, however, did not rest upon
Lord Kitchener's shoulders, but upon those of his
colleagues.  They understood the industrial
conditions of the United Kingdom; he did not and
could not; and they must have been well aware of
this fact.  It was not Lord Kitchener's business, nor
had he the time, to make himself familiar with those
matters which are so well understood by the Board
of Trade, the Local Government Board, and the
Treasury.  His business was to help France, to get
recruits as best he could, to train them as soon as
he could, and to send them out to beat the Germans.
It was the business of the Government&mdash;expert in
British political and industrial conditions&mdash;to put him
in the way of getting his recruits, and the equipment,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P363"></a>363}</span>
supplies, and munitions of war which were necessary
for making them effective.[<a id="chap0405fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0405fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0405fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0405fn1text">1</a>] I am specially referring to August-December 1914.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0405fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0405fn2text">2</a>] "I saw a statement the other day
<i>that the operations not only of our
Army but of our Allies were being crippled,
or at any rate hampered, by our
failure to provide the necessary ammunition</i>.
There is not a word of truth
in that statement.  I say there is not a word
of truth in that statement
which is the more mischievous because
if it were believed, it is calculated
to dishearten our troops,
to discourage our Allies, and to stimulate the
hopes and activities of our enemies.
Nor is there any more truth in the
suggestion that the Government,
of which I am the head, have only recently
become alive to the importance
and the urgency of these matters.  On the
contrary, in the earliest days of the war,
when some of our would-be
instructors were thinking of quite other things,
they were already receiving
our anxious attention, and as far back,
I think, as the month of September
I appointed a Committee of the Cabinet,
presided over by Lord Kitchener,
to survey the situation from this point
of view&mdash;a Committee whose
labours and inquiries resulted
in a very substantial enlargement both on
the field and of machinery of supply....
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"No, the urgency of the situation&mdash;and,
as I shall show, the urgency
is great&mdash;can be explained without any
resort to recrimination or to blame.
It is due, in the main, to two very obvious
causes.  It is due, first of all,
to the unprecedented scale upon which
ammunition on both sides has been,
and is being, expended.
<i>It not only goes far beyond all previous experience,
but it is greatly in advance
of the forecasts of the best experts</i>."&mdash;Mr. Asquith
at Newcastle, April 20, 1915.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0405fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap0405fn3text">3</a>] There has certainly been no lack
of appointments either of committees
or individuals.  So lately as the 7th
of April the newspapers announced a
War Office Committee "to secure that
the supply of munitions of war shall
be sufficient to meet all requirements."  About
a week later came the
announcement of a still more august
committee&mdash;'The Output Committee'&mdash;with Mr. Lloyd-George
as Chairman and Mr. Balfour as a member of it.
If war could be won by appointing committees
and creating posts, victory
ought long ago to have been secured.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0405fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap0405fn4text">4</a>] Since this chapter was printed (May 1915)
public opinion has been
somewhat distracted by a sensational wrangle
as to whether or not the
right kind of ammunition had been supplied.
These are technical matters
upon which the ordinary man is no judge.
The main point is that&mdash;certainly until quite
recently&mdash;enough ammunition was not supplied; nor
anything like enough; and this was due
to the failure to look far enough
ahead in the early days of the war;
and to organise our industrial system
to meet the inevitable requirements.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
METHODS OF RECRUITING
</h3>

<p>
If Lord Kitchener is not to be held primarily
responsible for the delay in providing war material,
just as little is he to be blamed for the methods of
recruiting.  For he had to take what the politicians
told him.  He had to accept their sagacious views
of what the people would stand; of 'what they would
never stand'; of what 'from the House of Commons'
standpoint' was practicable or impracticable.
</p>

<p>
Lord Kitchener wanted men.  During August
and September he wanted them at once&mdash;without a
moment's delay.  Obviously the right plan was to
ask in a loud voice who would volunteer; to take as
many of these as it was possible to house, clothe,
feed, and train; then to sit down quietly and consider
how many more were likely to be wanted, at what
dates, and how best they could be got.  But as
regards the first quarter of a million or so, which
there were means for training at once, there was
only one way&mdash;to call loudly for volunteers.  The
case was one of desperate urgency, and as things
then stood, it would have been the merest pedantry
to delay matters until a system, for which not even
a scheme or skeleton existed before the emergency
arose, had been devised.  The rough and ready
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P365"></a>365}</span>
method of calling out loudly was open to many
objections on the score both of justice and efficiency,
but the all-important thing was to save time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NEED FOR A SYSTEM
</span>
</p>

<p>
Presumably, by and by, when the first rush was
over, the Cabinet did sit down round a table to talk
things over.  We may surmise the character of the
conversation which was then poured into Lord
Kitchener's ears&mdash;how England would never stand
this or that; how no freeborn Englishman&mdash;especially
north of the Humber and the Trent,[<a id="chap0406fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn1">1</a>] whence the
Liberal party drew its chief support&mdash;would tolerate
being tapped on the shoulder and told to his face
by Government what his duty was; how much less
would he stand being coerced by Government into
doing it; how he must be tapped on the shoulder
and told by other people; how he must be coerced
by other people; how pressure must be put on by
private persons&mdash;employers by threats of dismissal&mdash;young
females of good, bad, and indifferent character
by blandishments and disdain.  The fear of starvation
for the freeborn Englishman and his family&mdash;at
that time a real and present danger with many minds&mdash;or
the shame of receiving a white feather, were the
forces by which England and the Empire were to be
saved at this time of trial.  Moreover, would it not
lead to every kind of evil if, at this juncture, the
country were to become annoyed with the Government?
Better surely that it should become annoyed
with any one rather than the Government, whose
patriotic duty, therefore, was to avoid unpopularity
with more devoted vigilance than heretofore, if such
a thing were possible.
</p>

<p>
One can imagine Lord Kitchener&mdash;somewhat weary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P366"></a>366}</span>
of discussions in this airy region, and sorely perplexed
by all these cobwebs of the party system&mdash;insisting
doggedly that his business was to make a New Army,
and to come to the assistance of France, without a
day's unnecessary delay.  He must have the men;
how was he to get the men?
</p>

<p>
And one can imagine the response.  "Put your
trust in us, and we will get you the men.  We
will go on shouting.  We will shout louder and
louder.  We will paste up larger and larger pictures
on the hoardings.  We will fill whole pages of
the newspapers with advertisements drawn up
by the 'livest publicity artists' of the day.  We
will enlist the sympathies and support of the
press&mdash;for this is not an Oriental despotism, but
a free country, where the power of the press is
absolute.  And if the sympathies of the press are
cool, or their support hangs back, we will threaten
them with the Press Bureau.  We will tell the
country-gentlemen, and the men-of-business, that
it is their duty to put on the screw; and most of
these, being easily hypnotised by the word 'duty,'
will never dream of refusing.  If their action is
resented, and they become disliked it will be
very regrettable; but taking a broad view, this
will not be injurious to the Liberal party in the
long run.
</p>

<p>
"Leave this little matter, Lord Kitchener, to
experts.  Lend your great name.  Allow us to
show your effigies to the people.  Consider what a
personal triumph for yourself if, at the end of this
great war, we can say on platforms that you and we
together have won it on the Voluntary System.
Trust in us and our methods.  We will boom your
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P367"></a>367}</span>
New Army, and we will see to it at the same time
that the Government does not become unpopular,
and also, if possible, that the Empire is saved."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE ADVERTISEMENT CAMPAIGN
</span>
</p>

<p>
So they boomed the Voluntary System and the
New Army in Periclean passages; touched with awe
the solemn chords; shouted as if it had been Jericho.
</p>

<p>
Two specimens, out of a large number of a
similar sort&mdash;the joint handiwork apparently of the
'publicity artists,' bettering the moving appeals of
the late Mr. Barnum, and of the party managers,
inspired by the traditions of that incomparable ex-whip,
Lord Murray of Elibank&mdash;are given below.[<a id="chap0406fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn2">2</a>]  It is of
course impossible to do justice here to the splendour
of headlines and leaded capitals; but the nature of
the appeal will be gathered clearly enough.  Briefly,
the motive of it was to avoid direct compulsion by
Government&mdash;which would have fallen equally and
fairly upon all&mdash;and to substitute for this, indirect
compulsion and pressure by private individuals&mdash;which
must of necessity operate unequally, unfairly,
and invidiously.  To say that this sort of thing is
not compulsion, is to say what is untrue.  If, as
appears to be the case, the voluntary system has
broken down, and we are to have compulsion, most
honest men and women will prefer that the compulsion
should be fair rather than unfair, direct rather than
indirect, and that it should be exercised by those
responsible for the government of the country, rather
than by private persons who cannot compel, but can
only penalise.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P368"></a>368}</span>
</p>

<p>
By these means, during the past six months, a
great army has been got together&mdash;an army great in
numbers,[<a id="chap0406fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn3">3</a>] still greater in spirit; probably one of the
noblest armies ever recruited in an cause.  And
Lord Kitchener has done his part by training this
army with incomparable energy, and by infusing into
officers and men alike his own indomitable resolution.
</p>

<p>
The high quality of the New Army is due to the
fact that the bulk of it consists of two kinds of men,
who of all others are the best material for soldiers.
It consists of men who love fighting for its own
sake&mdash;a small class.  It also consists of men who hate
fighting, but whose sense of duty is their guiding
principle&mdash;fortunately a very large class.  It consists
of many others as well, driven on by divers motives.
But the spirit of the New Army&mdash;according to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P369"></a>369}</span>
accounts of those who are in the best position to
judge&mdash;is the spirit of the first two classes&mdash;of the
fighters and the sense-of-duty men.  It is these who
have leavened it throughout.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ITS EFFECT ON PUBLIC OPINION
</span>
</p>

<p>
This magnificent result&mdash;for it is magnificent,
whatever may be thought of the methods which
achieved it&mdash;has been claimed in many quarters&mdash;Liberal,
Unionist, and non-party&mdash;as a triumph for
the voluntary system.  But if we proceed to question
it, how voluntary was it really?  Also how just?
Did the New Army include all, or anything like all,
those whose clear duty it was to join?  And did it
not include many people who ought never to have
been asked to join, or even allowed to join, until
others&mdash;whose ages, occupations, and responsibilities
marked them out for the first levies&mdash;had all been
called up?
</p>

<p>
There is also a further question&mdash;did the country,
reading these various advertisements and placards&mdash;heroic,
melodramatic, pathetic, and facetious&mdash;did
the country form a true conception of the gravity of
the position?  Was it not in many cases confused
and perplexed by the nature of the appeal?  Did
not many people conclude, that things could not
really be so very serious, if those in authority resorted
to such flamboyant and sensational methods&mdash;methods
so conspicuously lacking in dignity, so
inconsistent with all previous ideas of the majesty
of Government in times of national peril?
</p>

<p>
The method itself, no doubt, was only unfamiliar
in so far as it used the King's name.  It was familiar
and common enough in other connections.  But a
method which might have been unexceptionable for
calling attention to the virtues of a shop, a soap, a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P370"></a>370}</span>
circus, or a pill, seemed inappropriate in the case of
a great nation struggling at the crisis of its fate.[<a id="chap0406fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
Each of us must judge from his own experience
of the effect produced.  The writer has heard harsher
things said of these appeals by the poor, than by the
well-to-do.  The simplest and least sophisticated
minds are often the severest critics in matters of
taste as well as morals.  And this was a matter of
both.  Among townspeople as well as countryfolk
there were many who&mdash;whether they believed or
disbelieved in the urgent need, whether they responded
to the appeal or did not respond to it&mdash;regarded the
whole of this 'publicity' campaign with distrust
and dislike, as a thing which demoralised the country,
which was revolting to its honour and conscience,
and in which the King's name ought never to have
been used.[<a id="chap0406fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn5">5</a>]

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ON THE WORKING CLASSES
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the part of the working-classes there were
other objections to the methods employed.  They
resented the hints and instructions which were so
obligingly given by the 'publicity artists' and the
'party managers' to the well-to-do classes&mdash;to
employers of all sorts&mdash;as to how they should bring
pressure to bear upon their dependents.  And they
resented&mdash;especially the older men and those with
family responsibilities&mdash;the manner in which they
were invited by means of circulars to signify their
willingness to serve&mdash;as they imagined in the last dire
necessity&mdash;and when they had agreed patriotically to
do so, found themselves shortly afterwards called
upon to fulfil their contract.  For they knew that in
the neighbouring village&mdash;or in the very next
house&mdash;there were men much more eligible for military
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P372"></a>372}</span>
service in point of age and freedom from family
responsibilities, who, not having either volunteered,
or filled up the circular, were accordingly left
undisturbed to go about their daily business.[<a id="chap0406fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The attitude of the country generally at the
outbreak of war was admirable.  It was what it
should have been&mdash;as on a ship after a collision, where
crew and passengers, all under self-command, and
without panic, await orders patiently.  So the country
waited&mdash;waited for clear orders&mdash;waited to be told,
in tones free from all ambiguity and hesitation, what
they were to do as classes and as individuals.  There
was very little fuss or confusion.  People were
somewhat dazed for a short while by the financial crisis;
but the worst of that was soon over.  They then
said to themselves, "Let us get on with our ordinary
work as hard as usual (or even harder), until we
receive orders from those responsible for the ship's
safety, telling us what we are to do."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
BUSINESS AS USUAL
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was a certain amount of sparring, then and
subsequently, between high-minded journalists, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P373"></a>373}</span>
were engaged in carrying on their own <i>business as
usual</i>, and hard-headed traders and manufacturers
who desired to do likewise.  The former were perhaps
a trifle too self-righteous, while the latter took more
credit than they deserved for patriotism, seeing that
their chief merit was common sense.  To have stopped
the business of the country would have done nobody
but the Germans any good, and would have added
greatly to our national embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
At times of national crisis, there will always
be a tendency, among most men and women, to
misgivings, lest they may not be doing the full measure
of their duty.  Their consciences become morbidly
active; it is inevitable that they should; indeed it
would be regrettable if they did not.  People are
uncomfortable, unless they are doing something they
have never done before, which they dislike doing,
and which they do less well than their ordinary work.
In many cases what they are inspired to do is less
useful than would have been their ordinary work,
well and thoughtfully done.  At such times as these
the <i>Society for Setting Everybody Right</i> always
increases its activities, and enrols a large number of
new members.  But very soon, if there is leadership
of the nation, things fall into their proper places and
proportions.  Neither business nor pleasure can be
carried on as usual, and everybody knows it.  There
must be great changes; but not merely for the sake
of change.  There must be great sacrifices in many
cases; and those who are doing well must give a
helping hand to those others who are doing ill.  But
all&mdash;whether they are doing well or ill from the standpoint
of their own private interests&mdash;must be prepared to
do what the leader of the nation orders them to do.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P374"></a>374}</span>
This was fully recognised in August, September,
October, and November last.  The country expected
orders&mdash;clear and unmistakable orders&mdash;and it was
prepared to obey whatever orders it received.
</p>

<p>
But no orders came.  Instead of orders there were
appeals, warnings, suggestions, assurances.  The
panic-monger was let loose with his paint-box of
horrors.  The diffident parliamentarian fell to his
usual methods of soothing, and coaxing, and shaming
people into doing a very vague and much-qualified
thing, which he termed their duty.  But there was no
clearness, no firmness.  An ordinary man will realise
his duty so soon as he receives a definite command,
and not before.  He received no such command; he
was lauded, lectured, and exhorted; and then was left
to decide upon his course of action by the light of his
own reason and conscience.[<a id="chap0406fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
He was not even given a plain statement of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P375"></a>375}</span>
true facts of the situation, and then left at peace to
determine what he would do.  He was disturbed in
his meditations by shouting&mdash;more shouting&mdash;ever
louder and louder shouting&mdash;through some thousands
of megaphones.  The nature of the appeal was
emotional, confusing, frenzied, and at times degrading.
Naturally the results were in many directions most
unsatisfactory, unbusinesslike, and disorderly.  The
drain of recruiting affected industries and individuals
not only unequally and unfairly, but in a way
contrary to the public interest.  If Government will
not exercise guidance and control in unprecedented
circumstances, it is inevitable that the country must
suffer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
AN ORGIE OF SENSATIONALISM
</span>
</p>

<p>
To judge from the placards and the posters, the
pictures and the language, a casual stranger would
not have judged that the British Empire stood at
the crisis of its fate; but rather that some World's
Fair was arriving shortly, and that these were the
preliminary flourishes.  Lord Kitchener cannot have
enjoyed the pre-eminence which was allotted to him
in our mural decorations, and which suggested that
he was some kind of co-equal with the famous Barnum
or Lord George Sanger.  Probably no one alive hated
the whole of this orgie of vulgar sensationalism,
which the timidity of the politicians had forced upon
the country, more than he did.[<a id="chap0406fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P376"></a>376}</span>
</p>

<p>
Having stirred up good and true men to join the
New Army, whether it was rightly their turn or not;
having got at others in whom the voluntary spirit
burned less brightly, by urging their employers to
dismiss them and their sweethearts to throw them
over if they refused the call of duty, the 'publicity
artists' and the 'party managers' between them
undoubtedly collected for Lord Kitchener a very
fine army, possibly the finest raw material for an
army which has ever been got together.  And Lord
Kitchener, thereupon, set to work, and trained
this army as no one but Lord Kitchener could have
trained it.
</p>

<p>
These results were a source of great pride and
self-congratulation among the politicians.  The
voluntary principle&mdash;you see how it works!  What
a triumph!  What other nation could have done
the same?
</p>

<p>
Other nations certainly could not have done the
same, for the reason that there are some things which
one cannot do twice over, some things which one
cannot give a second time&mdash;one's life for example,
or the flower of the manhood of a nation to be made
into soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Other nations could not have done what we were
doing, because they had done it already.  They had
their men prepared when the need arose&mdash;which we
had not.  Other nations were engaged in holding the
common enemy at enormous sacrifices until we made
ourselves ready; until we&mdash;triumphing in our
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P377"></a>377}</span>
voluntary system, covering ourselves in self-praise,
and declaring to the world, through the mouths of
Sir John Simon and other statesmen, that each of
our men was worth at least three of their 'pressed
men' or conscripts&mdash;until we came up leisurely with
reinforcements&mdash;six, nine, or twelve months
hence&mdash;supposing that by such time, there was anything
still left to come up for.  If the Germans were then
in Paris, Bordeaux, Brest, and Marseilles, there
would be&mdash;temporarily at least&mdash;a great saving of
mortality among the British race.  If, on the other
hand, the Allies had already arrived at Berlin without
us, what greater triumph for the voluntary principle
could possibly be imagined?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A FRENCH VIEW
</span>
</p>

<p>
Putting these views and considerations&mdash;which
have so much impressed us all in our own recent
discussions&mdash;before a French officer, I found him
obstinate in viewing the matter at a different angle.
He was inclined to lay stress on the case of Northern
France, and even more on that of Belgium, whose
resistance to the German invasion we had wished for
and encouraged, and who was engaged in fighting
our battles quite as much as her own.  The voluntary
principle, in spite of its triumphs at home&mdash;which he
was not concerned to dispute&mdash;had not, he thought,
as yet been remarkably triumphant abroad; and
nine months had gone by since war began.
</p>

<p>
He insisted, moreover, that for years before war
was declared, our great British statesmen could not
have been ignorant of the European situation, either
in its political or its military aspects.  Such ignorance
was inconceivable.  They must have suspected the
intentions of Germany, and they must have known
the numbers of her army.  England had common
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P378"></a>378}</span>
interests with France.  Common interests, if there
be a loyal understanding, involve equal sacrifices&mdash;equality
of sacrifice not merely when the push comes,
but in advance of the crisis, in preparation for it&mdash;a
much more difficult matter.  Why then had not our
Government told the British people long ago what
sacrifice its safety, no less than its honour, required
of it to give?
</p>

<p>
I felt, after talking to my friend for some time,
that although he rated our nation in some ways very
highly indeed, although he was grateful for our
assistance, hopeful of the future, confident that in
Lord Kitchener we had found our man,
nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;not even selections from Mr. Spender's
articles in the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>, or from Sir John
Simon's speeches, or Sir John Brunner's assurances
about the protection afforded by international
law&mdash;could induce him to share our own enthusiasm for
the voluntary system....  <i>The triumph of the
voluntary system</i>, he cried bitterly, <i>is a German
triumph: it is the ruin of Belgium and the devastation
of France</i>.
</p>

<p>
And looking at the matter from a Frenchman's
point of view, there is something to be said for his
contention.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Apart from any objections which may exist to
British methods of recruiting since war broke out&mdash;to
their injustice, want of dignity, and generally to
their demoralising effect on public opinion&mdash;there
are several still more urgent questions to be
considered.  Have those methods been adequate?  And
if so, are they going to continue adequate to the end?
Is there, in short, any practical need for conscription?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P379"></a>379}</span>
</p>

<p>
We do not answer these questions by insisting
that, if there had been conscription in the past, we
should have been in a much stronger position when
war broke out; or by proving to our own satisfaction,
that if we had possessed a national army, war would
never have occurred.  Such considerations as these
are by no means done with; they are indeed still
very important; but they lie rather aside from the
immediate question with which we are now faced,
and which, for lack of any clear guidance from those
in authority, many of us have been endeavouring of
late to solve by the light of our own judgment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NEED FOR NATIONAL SERVICE
</span>
</p>

<p>
The answer which the facts supply does not seem
to be in any doubt.  We need conscription to bring
this war to a victorious conclusion.  We need
conscription no less in order that we may impose terms
of lasting peace.  Conscription is essential to the
proper organisation not only of our manhood, but
also of our national resources.[<a id="chap0406fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0406fn9">9</a>]  Judging by the
increasing size, frequency, and shrillness of recent
recruiting advertisements, conscription would seem
to be equally essential in order to secure the number
of recruits necessary for making good the wastage of
war, even in the present preliminary stage of the war.
And morally, conscription is essential in order that
the whole nation may realise, before it is too late, the
life-or-death nature of the present struggle; in order
also that other nations&mdash;our Allies as well as our
enemies&mdash;may understand&mdash;what they certainly do
not understand at present&mdash;that our spirit is as firm
and self-sacrificing as their own.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The voluntary system has broken down long ago.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P380"></a>380}</span>
It broke down on the day when the King of England
declared war upon the Emperor of Germany.  From
that moment it was obvious that, in a prolonged war,
the voluntary system could not be relied upon to
give us, in an orderly and businesslike way, the
numbers which we should certainly require.  It was
also obvious that it was just as inadequate for the
purpose of introducing speed, order, and efficiency
into the industrial world, as strength into our military
affairs.
</p>

<p>
So far, however, most of the accredited oracles of
Government have either denounced national military
service as un-English, and a sin against freedom; or
else they have evaded the issue, consoling their
various audiences with the reflection, that it will be
time enough to talk of compulsion, when it is clearly
demonstrated that the voluntary system can no longer
give us what we need.  It seems improvident to
wait until the need has been proved by the painful
process of failure.  The curses of many dead nations
lie upon the procrastination of statesmen, who waited
for breakdown to prove the necessity of sacrifice.
Compulsion, like other great changes, cannot be
systematised and put through in a day.  It needs
preparation.  If the shoe begins to pinch severely
in August, and we only then determine to adopt
conscription, what relief can we hope to experience
before the following midsummer?  And in what
condition of lameness may the British Empire be by
then?
</p>

<p>
"But what," it may be asked, "of all the official
and semi-official statements which have been uttered
in a contrary sense?  Surely the nation is bound
to trust its own Government, even although no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P381"></a>381}</span>
facts and figures are offered in support of their
assurances."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
VALUE OF OFFICIAL ASSURANCES
</span>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately it is impossible to place an implicit
faith in official and semi-official statements, unless
we have certain knowledge that they are confirmed
by the facts.  There has been an abundance of such
statements in recent years&mdash;with regard to the
innocence of Germany's intentions&mdash;with regard to
the adequacy of our own preparations&mdash;while only
a few weeks ago Mr. Asquith himself was assuring us
that neither the operations of our own army, nor
those of our Allies' armies, had ever been crippled,
or even hampered, by any want of munitions.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, assurances flow from the same
source&mdash;assurances that there is no need for
compulsory military service&mdash;that the voluntary system
has given, is giving, and will continue to give us all
we require&mdash;we may be forgiven for expressing our
incredulity.  Such official and semi-official
statements are not supported by any clear proofs.  They
are contradicted by much that we have heard from
persons who are both honest, and in a position to know.
They are discredited by our own eyes when we read the
recruiting advertisements and posters.  It seems safer,
therefore, to dismiss these official and semi-official
assurances, and trust for once to our instinct and
the evidence of our own senses.  It seems safer also
not to wait for complete breakdown in war, or
mortifying failure in negotiations for peace, in order
to have the need for national service established
beyond a doubt.

that I have taken the liberty
of quoting it in full:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"DEAR SIR&mdash;Every day you tell your
readers that we are collecting
troops by means of voluntary enlistment,
yet it is self-evident that our
recruiting campaign from the first
has been a very noisy and a very vulgar
compulsion, which in a time of immense
crisis has lowered the dignity of
our country and provoked much anxiety
among our Allies.  Our national
habit of doing the right thing in the
wrong way has never been exercised
in a more slovenly and unjust manner.
It is a crime against morals not
to use the equitable principles
of national service when our country is
fighting for her life; and this obvious
truth should be recognised as a
matter of course by every true democrat.
A genuinely democratic people,
proud of their past history,
and determined to hold their own against
Germany's blood-lust, would have divided
her male population into classes,
and would have summoned each class
to the colours at a given date.
Those who were essential to the leading trades
of the country would have
been exempted from war service in the field,
as they are in Germany;
the younger classes would have been called up first,
and no class would
have been withdrawn from its civil work
until the military authorities
were ready to train it.
Instead of this quiet and dignified justice, this
admirable and quiet unity of a
free people inspired by a fine patriotism,
we have dazed ourselves with shrieking
posters and a journalistic clamour
against 'shirkers,' and loud abuse
of professional footballers; and now
an advertisement in the newspapers assures
the women of England that
<i>they</i> must do what the State declines to achieve,
that they must send their
men and boys into the field since their country
is fighting for her life.  What
cowardice!  Why impose this voluntary duty
on women when the State
is too ignoble to look upon her own duty
in this matter as a moral obligation?

"The one virtue of voluntary enlistment
is that it should be voluntary&mdash;a
free choice between a soldier's life
and a civilian's life.  To use moral
pressure, with the outcries of public
indignation, in order to drive civilians
from their work into the army&mdash;what
is this but a most undignified
compulsion?  And it is also a compulsion
that presses unequally upon the
people, for its methods are without system.
Many families send their
all into the fighting line; many decline
to be patriotic.  A woman said
to me yesterday: 'My husband has gone,
and I am left with his business.
Why should he go?  Other women in my
neighbourhood have their
husbands still, and it's rubbish
to say that the country is in danger when
the Government allows and encourages
this injustice in recruiting.  If
the country is in danger all the men

[<a href="#chap0406fn6text">6</a>] There have been bitter complaints
of this artful way of getting recruits,
as a boy 'sniggles' trout.
The following letter to the Times (April 21,
1915) voices a very widely spread sense of injustice:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"SIR&mdash;Will you give me the opportunity
to ask a question, which I
think you will agree is important?
When the Circular to Householders
was issued, many heads of families gave
in their names on the assumption
that they would be called up on the
last resort, and under circumstances
in which no patriotic man could refuse his help.
Married men with large
families are now being called up apparently
without the slightest regard
to their home circumstances.
Many of the best of them are surprised and
uneasy at leaving their families,
but feel bound in honour to keep their
word, some even thinking they have no choice.
The separation allowances
for these families will be an immense burden
on the State, and, if the
breadwinner falls, a permanent burden.
Is the need for men still so
serious and urgent as to justify this?
If it is, then I for one, who have
up to now hoped that the war might
be put through without compulsion,
feel that the time has come to 'fetch'
the unmarried shirkers, and I
believe there is a wide-spread and
growing feeling to that effect.&mdash;I am,

<a id="chap0406fn7"></a>
[<a href="#chap0406fn7text">7</a>] An example of the apparent inability
of the Government to do anything thoroughly or
courageously is found in a circular letter to shopkeepers
and wholesale firms, which was lately
sent out by the Home Secretary and
the President of the Board of Trade.
The object of this enquiry&mdash;undertaken
at leisure, nine months after
the outbreak of war&mdash;is to obtain information
as to the number of men of military age,
who are still employed in these
particular trades, and as to the
willingness of their employers to spare them
if required, and to reinstate them
at the end of the war, etc., etc.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
The timid futility of this attempt
at organising the resources of the
country is shown <i>first</i> by the fact
that it left to the option of each employer
whether he will reply or not.
Businesses which do not wish to have their
employees taken away need not give an answer.
It is compulsory for
individuals to disclose all particulars
of their income; why, therefore, need
Government shrink from making it compulsory
upon firms to disclose all
particulars of their staffs? ... The <i>second</i>
vice of this application is that
the information asked for is quite inadequate
for the object.  Even if the
enquiry were answered faithfully by every
employer and householder in
the country, it would not give the Government
what they require for the
purposes of organising industry or recruiting
the army....  In the <i>third</i>
place, a certain group of trades is singled
out at haphazard.  If it is desired
to organise the resources of the country
what is needed is a general census
of all males between 16 and 60.

the poster which is more remarkable

a garish but recognisable portrait
of Lord Roberts, with the motto,

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
PERVERSITIES OF THE ANTI-MILITARIST SPIRIT
</h3>

<p>
If 'National Service,' or 'Conscription,' has
actually become necessary already, or may
conceivably become so before long, it seems worth
while to glance at some of the considerations which
have been urged in favour of this system in the
past, and also to examine some of the causes and
conditions which have hitherto led public opinion in
the United Kingdom, as well as in several of the
Dominions, to regard the principle of compulsion
with hostility and distrust.  The true nature of
what we call the 'Voluntary System,' and the reasons
which have induced a large section of our
fellow-countrymen to regard it as one of our most sacred
institutions, are worth looking into, now that
circumstances may force us to abandon it in the near
future.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the question, whether the system of
recruiting, which has been employed during the
present war, can correctly be described as 'voluntary,'
there is the further question, whether the system,
which is in use at ordinary times, and which produces
some 35,000 men per annum, can be so described.
Lord Roberts always maintained that it could not, and
that its true title was 'the Conscription of Hunger.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P383"></a>383}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NORMAL RECRUITING METHODS
</span>
</p>

<p>
Any one who has watched the recruiting-sergeant
at work, on a raw cold day of winter or early spring,
will be inclined to agree with Lord Roberts.  A fine,
good-humoured, well-fed, well-set-up fellow, in a
handsome uniform, with rows of medals which light
up the mean and dingy street, lays himself alongside
some half-starved poor devil, down in his luck, with
not a rag to his back that the north wind doesn't
blow through.  The appetites and vanities of the
latter are all of them morbidly alert&mdash;hunger, thirst,
the desire for warmth, and to cut a smart figure in
the world.  The astute sergeant, though no professor
of psychology, understands the case thoroughly, as he
marks down his man.  He greets him heartily with
a 'good day' that sends a glow through him, even
before the drink at the Goat and Compasses, or Green
Dragon has been tossed off, and the King's shilling
accepted.
</p>

<p>
Not that there is any need for pity or regret.
These young men with empty bellies, and no very
obvious way of filling them, except by violence&mdash;these
lads with gloom at their hearts, in many cases
with a burden of shame weighing on them at having
come into such a forlorn pass&mdash;in nine cases out of
ten enlistment saves them; perhaps in more even
than that.
</p>

<p>
But talk about compulsion and the voluntary
principle!  What strikes the observer most about
such a scene as this is certainly not anything which
can be truly termed 'voluntary.'  If one chooses to
put things into ugly words&mdash;which is sometimes
useful, in order to give a shock to good people who
are tending towards self-righteousness in their worship
of phrases&mdash;this is the compulsion of hunger and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P384"></a>384}</span>
misery.  It might even be contended that it was not
only compulsion, but a mean, sniggling kind of
compulsion, taking advantage of a starving man.
</p>

<p>
The law is very chary of enforcing promises made
under duress.  If a man dying of thirst signs his
birthright away, or binds himself in service for a term
of years, in exchange for a glass of water, the ink
and paper have no validity.  But the recruit is
firmly bound.  He has made a contract to give his
labour, and to risk his life for a long period of years,
at a wage which is certainly below the market rate;
and he is held to it.  Things much more 'voluntary'
than this have been dubbed 'slavery,' and denounced
as 'tainted with servile conditions.'  And the loudest
denunciators have been precisely those anti-militarists,
who uphold our 'voluntary' system with the hottest
fervour, while reprobating 'compulsion' with the
utmost horror.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MORAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS
</span>
</p>

<p>
We have heard much caustic abuse of the National
Service League.  It has been accused of talking 'the
cant of compulsion'; by which has been meant that
certain of its members have put in the forefront of
their argument the moral and physical advantages
which they imagine universal military training would
confer upon the nation.  Some may possibly have
gone too far, and lost sight of the need of the nation,
in their enthusiasm for the improvement of the
individual.  But if occasionally their arguments
assume the form of cant, can their lapse be compared
with the cant which tells the world smugly that
the British Army is recruited on the voluntary
principle?
</p>

<p>
The 'economic argument,' as it is called, is
another example.  The country would be faced with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P385"></a>385}</span>
ruin, we are told, if every able-bodied man had to
give 'two of the best years of his life,'[<a id="chap0407fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0407fn1">1</a>] and a week
or two out of each of the ensuing seven, to
'unproductive' labour.  Sums have been worked out the
to hundreds of millions sterling, with the object of
showing that the national loss, during a single generation,
would make the national debt appear insignificant.
How could Britain maintain her industrial
pre-eminence weighted with such a handicap?
</p>

<p>
One answer is that Britain, buoyed up though
she has been by her voluntary system, has not lately
been outstripping those of her competitors who
carried this very handicap which it is now proposed
that she should carry; that she has not even been
maintaining her relative position in the industrial
world in comparison, for example, with Germany.
</p>

<p>
But there is also another answer.  If you take
a youth at the plastic age when he has reached
manhood, feed him on wholesome food, subject him
to vigorous and varied exercise, mainly in the open
air, discipline him, train him to co-operation with
his fellows, make him smart and swift in falling-to
at whatever work comes under his hand, you are
thereby giving him precisely what, for his own sake
and that of the country, is most needed at the present
time.  You are giving him the chance of developing
his bodily strength under healthy conditions, and
you are giving him a general education and moral
training which, in the great majority of cases, will
be of great value to him in all his after life.
</p>

<p>
It is the regret of every one, who has studied our
industrial system from within, that men wear out too
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P386"></a>386}</span>
soon.  By the time a man reaches his fortieth
year&mdash;often earlier&mdash;he is too apt, in many vocations, to
be an old man; and for that reason he is in danger
of being shoved out of his place by a younger
generation.
</p>

<p>
This premature and, for the most part, unnecessary
ageing is the real economic loss.  If by taking two
years out of a man's life as he enters manhood, if by
improving his physique and helping him to form
healthy habits, you can thereby add on ten or fifteen
years to his industrial efficiency, you are not only
contributing to his own happiness, but are also adding
enormously to the wealth and prosperity of the
country.  Any one indeed, who chooses to work out
sums upon this hypothesis, will hardly regard the
national debt as a large enough unit for comparison.
The kernel of this matter is, that men wear out in
the working classes earlier than in others, mainly
because they have no break, no rest, no change,
from the day they leave school to take up a trade,
till the day when they have to hand in their checks
for good and all.  It is not effort, but drudgery, which
most quickly ages a man.  It is the rut&mdash;straight,
dark, narrow, with no horizons, and no general view
of the outside world&mdash;which is the greatest of social
dangers.  More than anything else it tends to
narrowness of sympathy and bitterness of heart.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
UNDER-RATING OF CONSCRIPT ARMIES
</span>
</p>

<p>
It would be cant to claim that universal military
training will get rid of this secular evil; but to say
that it will help to diminish it is merely the truth.
The real 'cant' is to talk about the economic loss
under conscription; for there would undoubtedly be
an immense economic gain.
</p>

<p>
But indeed the advocacy of the voluntary system
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P387"></a>387}</span>
is stuffed full of cant....  We are all proud of
our army; and rightly so.  But the opponents of
universal military service go much further in this
direction than the soldiers themselves.  They
contrast our army, to its enormous advantage, with the
conscript armies of the continent, which they regard
as consisting of vastly inferior fighting men&mdash;of men,
in a sense despicable, inasmuch as their meek spirits
have submitted tamely to conscription.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Seely, who, when he touches arithmetic
soars at once into the region of poetry, has pronounced
confidently that one of our voluntary soldiers is
worth ten men whom the law compels to serve.
Sir John Simon was still of opinion&mdash;even after several
months of war&mdash;that one of our volunteers was worth
at least three conscripts; and he was convinced that
the Kaiser himself already knew it.  What a splendid
thing if Colonel Seely were right, or even if Sir John
Simon were right!
</p>

<p>
But is either of them right?  So far as our
voluntary army is superior&mdash;and it was undoubtedly
superior in certain respects at the beginning of the
war&mdash;it was surely not because it was a 'voluntary'
army; but because, on the average, it had undergone
a longer and more thorough course of training than
the troops against which it was called upon to fight.
Fine as its spirit was, and high as were both its
courage and its intelligence, who has ever heard
a single soldier maintain that&mdash;measured through
and through&mdash;it was in those respects superior
to the troops alongside which, or against which it
fought?
</p>

<p>
As the war has continued month after month,
and men with only a few months' training have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P388"></a>388}</span>
drafted across the Channel to supply the British
wastage of war, even this initial superiority which
came of longer and more thorough training has
gradually been worn away.  A time will come, no
doubt&mdash;possibly it has already come&mdash;when Germany,
having used up her trained soldiers of sound physique,
has to fall back upon an inferior quality.  But that
is merely exhaustion.  It does not prove the
superiority of the voluntary system.  It does not
affect the comparison between men of equal stamina
and spirit&mdash;one set of whom has been trained beforehand
in arms&mdash;the other not put into training until
war began.
</p>

<p>
Possibly Colonel Seely spoke somewhat lightly
and thoughtlessly in those serene days before the
war-cloud burst; but Sir John Simon spoke deliberately&mdash;his
was the voice of the Cabinet, after months of
grim warfare.  To describe his utterances as cant
does not seem unjust, though possibly it is inadequate.
We are proud of our army, not merely because of
its fine qualities, but for the very fact that it is
what we choose to call a 'voluntary' army.  But
what do they say of it in foreign countries?  What
did the whole of Europe say of it during the South
African War?  What are the Germans saying of it now?
</p>

<p>
Naturally prejudice has led them to view the facts
at a different angle.  They have seldom referred to
the 'voluntary' character of our army.  That was
not the aspect which attracted their attention, so
much as the other aspect, that our soldiers received
pay, and therefore, according to German notions,
'fought for hire.'  At the time of the South African
War all continental nations said of our army what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P389"></a>389}</span>
the Germans still say&mdash;not that it was a 'voluntary'
army, but that it was a 'mercenary' army; and this
is a much less pleasant-sounding term.[<a id="chap0407fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0407fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE CANT OF MILITARISM
</span>
</p>

<p>
In this accusation we find the other kind of cant&mdash;the
cant of militarism.  For if ours is a mercenary
army, so is their own, in so far as the officers and
non-commissioned officers are concerned.  But as a
matter of fact no part, either of our army or the
existing German army, can with any truth be described
as 'mercenaries'; for this is a term applicable only
to armies&mdash;much more common in the past in
Germany than anywhere else&mdash;who were hired out
to fight abroad in quarrels which were not their own.
</p>

<p>
But although this German accusation against the
character of our troops is pure cant, it would not
be wholly so were it levelled against the British
people.  Not our army, but we ourselves, are the
true mercenaries; because we pay others to do for
us what other nations do for themselves.  In German
eyes&mdash;and perhaps in other eyes as well, which are
less willing to see our faults&mdash;this charge against the
British people appears maintainable.  It is
incomprehensible to other nations, why we should refuse to
recognise that it is any part of our duty, <i>as a people</i>,
to defend our country; why we will not admit the
obligation either to train ourselves to arms in time
of peace, or to risk our lives in time of war; why we
hold obstinately to it that such things are no part of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P390"></a>390}</span>
our duty as a people, but are only the duty of private
individuals who love fighting, or who are endowed
with more than the average sense of duty.
</p>

<p>
"As for you, the great British People," writes
Hexenkchen contemptuously, "you merely fold your
hands, and say self-righteously, that your duty begins
and ends with paying certain individuals to fight
for you&mdash;individuals whose personal interest can be
tempted with rewards; whose weakness of character
can be influenced by taunts, and jeers, and threats
of dismissal; or who happen to see their duty in a
different light from the great majority which calls
itself (and is <i>par excellence</i>) the British People...."  This
may be a very prejudiced view of the matter,
but it is the German view.  What they really mean
when they say that England is to be despised because
she relies upon a mercenary army, is that England
is to be despised because, being mercenary, she relies
upon a professional army.  The taunt, when we
come to analyse it, is found to be levelled, not against
the hired, but against the hirers; and although we
may be very indignant, it is not easy to disprove its
justice.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The British nation, if not actually the richest,
is at any rate one of the richest in the world.  It has
elected to depend for its safety upon an army which
cannot with justice be called either 'voluntary' or
'mercenary,' but which it is fairly near the truth
to describe as 'professional.'  The theory of our
arrangement is that we must somehow, and at the
cheapest rate, contrive to tempt enough men to
become professional soldiers to ensure national safety.
Accordingly we offer such inducements to take up
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P391"></a>391}</span>
the career of arms&mdash;instead of the trades of farm
labourer, miner, carpenter, dock hand, shopkeeper,
lawyer, physician, or stockbroker&mdash;as custom and
the circumstances of the moment appear to require.
</p>

<p>
In an emergency we offer high pay and generous
separation allowances to the private soldier.  In
normal times we give him less than the market rate
of wages.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
PAY OF THE BRITISH ARMY
</span>
</p>

<p>
The pay of junior or subaltern officers is so meagre
that it cannot, by any possibility, cover the expenses
which Government insists upon their incurring.
Captains, majors, and lieutenant-colonels are paid
much less than the wages of foremen or sub-managers
in any important industrial undertaking.  Even for
those who attain the most brilliant success in their
careers, there are no prizes which will stand
comparison for a moment with a very moderate degree
of prosperity in the world of trade or finance.  They
cannot even be compared with the prizes open to the
bar or the medical profession.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto we have obtained our officers largely
owing to a firmly rooted tradition among the country
gentlemen and the military families&mdash;neither as a
rule rich men, or even very easy in their circumstances
as things go nowadays&mdash;many of them very poor&mdash;a
tradition so strong that it is not cant, but plain truth,
to call it sense of duty.  There are other motives, of
course, which may lead a boy to choose this profession&mdash;love
of adventure, comparative freedom from indoor
life, pleasant comradeship, and in the case of the
middle classes, recently risen to affluence, social
aspirations.  But even in the last there is far more
good than harm; though in anti-militarist circles it
is the unworthy aim which is usually dwelt upon with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P392"></a>392}</span>
a sneering emphasis.  For very often, when a man
has risen from humble circumstances to a fortune, he
rejoices that his sons should serve the state, since it
is in his power to make provision.  The example of
his neighbours, whose ancestors have been living on
their acres since the days of the Plantagenets or
the Tudors, is a noble example; and he is wise to
follow it.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the rank and file of our army, a
contract for a term of years (with obligations
continuing for a further term of years) is entered into,
and signed, under the circumstances which have
already been considered.  We are faced here with
a phenomenon which seems strange in an Age which
has conceded the right to 'down tools,' even though
by so doing a solemn engagement is broken&mdash;in an
Age which has become very fastidious about hiring
agreements of most kinds, very suspicious of anything
suggestive of 'servile conditions' or 'forced labour,'
and which deprecates the idea of penalising breach of
contract, on the part of a workman, even by process
in the civil courts.
</p>

<p>
As regards a private soldier in the British army,
however, the Age apparently has no such
compunctions.  His contract has been made under
duress.  Its obligations last for a long period of
years.  The pay is below the ordinary market rates.
Everything in fact which, in equity, would favour
a revision, pleads in favour of the soldier who
demands to be released.  But let him plead and
threaten as he please, he is not released.  It is not a
case of suing him for damages in the civil courts, but
of dealing with him under discipline and mutiny
acts, the terms of which are simple and drastic&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P393"></a>393}</span>
peace time imprisonment, in war time death.
Without these means of enforcing the 'voluntary'
system the British people would not feel themselves
safe.
</p>

<p>
This phenomenon seems even stranger, when we
remember that a large and influential part of the
British people is not only very fastidious as to the
terms of all other sorts of hiring agreements, as to
rates of pay, and as to the conditions under which such
contracts have been entered into&mdash;that it is not only
most tender in dealing with the breach of such
agreements&mdash;but that it also regards the object of the
agreement for military service with particular
suspicion.  This section of the British people is
anti-militarist on conscientious grounds.  One would have
thought, therefore, that it might have been more
than usually careful to allow the man, who hires
himself out for lethal purposes, to have the benefit of
second thoughts; or even of third, fourth, and fifth
thoughts.  For he, too, may develop a conscience
when his belly is no longer empty.  But no: to do
this would endanger the 'voluntary' system.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE ANTI-MILITARIST CONSCIENCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
This anti-militarist section of the British people is
composed of citizens who, if we are to believe their own
professions, love peace more than other men love it,
and hate violence as a deadly sin.  They are
determined not to commit this deadly sin themselves;
but being unable to continue in pursuit of their
material and spiritual affairs, unless others will sin
in their behalf, they reluctantly agree to hire&mdash;at as
low a price as possible&mdash;a number of wild fellows from
the upper classes and wastrels from the lower classes&mdash;both
of whom they regard as approximating to the
reprobate type&mdash;to defend their property, to keep
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P394"></a>394}</span>
their lives safe, to enforce their Will as it is declared
by ballot papers and House of Commons divisions,
and to allow them to continue their careers of
beneficent self-interest undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
But for all that, we are puzzled by the rigour
with which the contract for military service is enforced,
even to the last ounce of the pound of flesh.  Not a
murmur of protest comes from this section of the
British people, although it has professed to take the
rights of the poorer classes as its special province.  The
explanation probably is that, like King Charles I.,
they have made a mental reservation, and are thus
enabled to distinguish the case of the soldier from
that of his brother who engages in a civil occupation.
</p>

<p>
Roughly speaking, they choose to regard the
civilian as virtuous, while the soldier, on the other
hand, cannot safely be presumed to be anything of
the sort.  Sometimes indeed&mdash;perhaps more often
than not&mdash;he appears to them to be distinctly
unvirtuous.  The presumption is against him; for if he
were really virtuous, how could he ever have agreed
to become a soldier, even under pressure of want?
For regulating the service of such men as these force
is a regrettable, but necessary, instrument.  The
unvirtuous man has agreed to sin, and the virtuous
man acts justly in holding him to his bargain.  If a
soldier develops a conscience, and insists on 'downing
tools' it is right to imprison him; even in certain
circumstances to put him against a wall and shoot him.
</p>

<p>
These ideas wear an odd appearance when we
come to examine them closely, and yet not only did
they exist, but they were actually very prevalent
down to the outbreak of the present war.  They
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P395"></a>395}</span>
seem to be somewhat prevalent, even now, in various
quarters.  But surely it is strange that virtuous
citizens should need the protection of unvirtuous
ones; that they should underpay; that they should
adopt the methods of 'forced labour' as a necessary
part of the 'voluntary system'; that they should
imprison and shoot men for breach of hiring
agreements&mdash;hiring agreements for long periods of years,
entered into under pressure of circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ANTI-MILITARIST CONFIDENCE
</span>
</p>

<p>
But there is a thing even stranger than any of
these.  Considering how jealous the great
anti-militarist section of our fellow-countrymen is of
anything which places the army in a position to
encroach upon, or overawe, the civil power, it seems
very remarkable that they should nevertheless have
taken a large number of men&mdash;whose morals, in their
view, were below rather than above the average&mdash;should
have armed them with rifles and bayonets, and
spent large sums of money in making them as efficient
as possible for lethal purposes, while refusing firmly to
arm <i>themselves</i> with anything but ballot-boxes, or
to make themselves fit for any form of self-defence.
</p>

<p>
It seems never to have crossed the minds of the
anti-militarist section that those whom they thus
regard&mdash;if not actually with moral reprehension,
at any rate somewhat askance&mdash;might perhaps some
day discover that there were advantages in being
armed, and in having become lethally efficient; that
having studied the phenomena of strikes, and having
there seen force of various kinds at work&mdash;hiring
agreements broken, combinations to bring pressure
on society successful, rather black things occasionally
hushed up and forgiven&mdash;soldiers might draw their
own conclusions.  Having grown tired of pay lower
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P396"></a>396}</span>
than the market rate, still more tired of moral lectures
about the wickedness of their particular trade, and
of tiresome old-fashioned phrases about the
subordination of the military to the civil power&mdash;what if
they, like other trades and classes, should begin to
consider the propriety of putting pressure on society,
since such pressure appears nowadays to be one of the
recognised instruments for redress of wrongs? ... Have
not professional soldiers the power to put
pressure on society in the twentieth century, just as
they have done, again and again, in past times in
other kingdoms and democracies, where personal
freedom was so highly esteemed, that even the freedom
to abstain from defending your country was respected
by public opinion and the laws of the land?
</p>

<p>
But nonsense!  In Germany, France, Russia,
Austria, Italy, and other conscript countries armies
are hundreds of times stronger than our own, while
the soldiers in these cases are hardly paid enough to
keep a smoker in pipe-tobacco.  And yet they do
not think of putting pressure on society, or of
anything so horrible.  This of course is true; but then,
in these instances, the Army is only Society itself
passing, as it were, like a may-fly, through a certain
stage in its life-history.  Army and Society in the
conscript countries are one and the same.  A man
does not think of putting undue pressure upon
himself.  But in our case the Army and Society are
not one and the same.  Their relations are those of
employer and employed, as they were in Rome long
ago; and as between employer and employed, there
are always apt to be questions of pay and position.
</p>

<p>
It is useful in this connection to think a little
of Rome with its 'voluntary' or 'mercenary' or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P397"></a>397}</span>
'professional' army&mdash;an army underpaid at first,
afterwards perhaps somewhat overpaid, when it
occurred to its mind to put pressure on society.
</p>

<p>
But Rome in the first century was a very different
place from England in the twentieth.  Very different
indeed!  The art and rules of war were considerably
less of an expert's business than they are to-day.
Two thousand years ago&mdash;weapons being still
somewhat elementary&mdash;gunpowder not yet discovered&mdash;no
railway trains and tubes, and outer and inner
circles, which now are as necessary for feeding great
cities as arteries and veins for keeping the human
heart going&mdash;private citizens, moreover, being not
altogether unused to acting with violence in
self-defence&mdash;it might have taken, perhaps, 100,000
disciplined and well-led reprobates a week or more to
hold the six millions of Greater London by the throat.
To-day 10,000 could do this with ease between
breakfast and dinner-time.  Certainly a considerable
difference&mdash;but somehow not a difference which
seems altogether reassuring.
</p>

<p>
Since the days of Oliver Cromwell the confidence
of the anti-militarists in the docility of the British
Army has never experienced any serious shock.  But
yet, according to the theories of this particular school,
why should our army alone, of all trades and professions,
be expected not to place its own class interests
before those of the country?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ARMIES AS LIBERATORS
</span>
</p>

<p>
When professional armies make their first entry
into practical politics it is almost always in the role
of liberators and defenders of justice.  An instance
might easily occur if one or other set of politicians,
in a fit of madness or presumption, were to ask, or
order, the British Army to undertake certain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P398"></a>398}</span>
operations against a section of their fellow-countrymen,
which the soldiers themselves judged to be contrary
to justice and their own honour.
</p>

<p>
Something of this kind very nearly came to pass
in March 1914.  The Curragh incident, as it was
called, showed in a flash what a perilous gulf opens,
when a professional army is mishandled.  Politicians,
who have come by degrees to regard the army&mdash;not
as a national force, or microcosm of the people, but
as an instrument which electoral success has placed
temporarily in their hands, and which may therefore
be used legitimately for forwarding their own party
ends&mdash;have ever been liable to blunder in this
direction.
</p>

<p>
Whatever may have been the merits of the Curragh
case, the part which the British Army was asked and
expected to play on that occasion, was one which
no democratic Government would have dared to
order a conscript army to undertake, until it had been
ascertained, beyond any possibility of doubt, that
the country as a whole believed extreme measures
to be necessary for the national safety.
</p>

<p>
If professional soldiers, however high and patriotic
their spirit, be treated as mercenaries&mdash;as if, in their
dealings with their fellow-countrymen, they had
neither souls nor consciences&mdash;it can be no matter for
surprise if they should come by insensible degrees to
think and act as mercenaries....  One set or other of
party politicians&mdash;the occurrence is quite as conceivable
in the case of a Unionist Government as in that
of a Liberal&mdash;issues certain orders, which it would
never dare to issue to a conscript army, and these
orders, to its immense surprise, are not obeyed.
Thereupon a Government, which only the day before
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P399"></a>399}</span>
seemed to be established securely on a House of
Commons majority and the rock of tradition, is seen
to be powerless.  The army in its own eyes&mdash;possibly
in that of public opinion also&mdash;has stood between the
people and injustice.  It has refused to be made the
instrument for performing an act of tyranny and
oppression.  Possibly in sorrow and disgust it
dissolves itself and ceases to exist.  Possibly, on the
other hand, it glows with the approbation of its own
conscience; begins to admire its own strength, and
not improbably to wonder, if it might not be good for
the country were soldiers to put forth their strong
arm rather more often, in order to restrain the
politicians from following evil courses.  This of course is
the end of democracy and the beginning of militarism.
</p>

<p>
An army which starts by playing the popular
role of benefactor, or liberator, will end very speedily
by becoming the instrument of a military despotism.
We need look no farther back than Cromwell and
his major-generals for an example.  We have been
in the habit of regarding such contingencies as remote
and mediaeval; none the less we had all but started
on this fatal course in the spring and summer of last
year.  We were then saved, not by the wisdom of
statesmen&mdash;for these only increased the danger by
the spectacle which they afforded of timidity, temper,
and equivocation&mdash;but solely by the present war
which, though it has brought us many horrors, has
averted, for a time at least, what is infinitely the
worst of all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
SERVICE AND SUFFRAGE
</span>
</p>

<p>
The conclusion is plain.  A democracy which
asserts the right of manhood suffrage, while denying
the duty of manhood service, is living in a fool's
paradise.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P400"></a>400}</span>
</p>

<p>
A democracy which does not fully identify itself
with its army, which does not treat its army with
honour and as an equal, but which treats it, on the
contrary, as ill-bred and ill-tempered people treat
their servants&mdash;with a mixture, that is, of fault-finding
and condescension&mdash;is following a very perilous
path.
</p>

<p>
An army which does not receive the treatment it
deserves, and which at the same time is ordered by
the politicians to perform services which, upon
occasions, it may hold to be inconsistent with its
honour, is a danger to the state.
</p>

<p>
A democracy which, having refused to train itself
for its own defence, thinks nevertheless that it can
safely raise the issue of 'the Army versus the People,'
is mad.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
SOME HISTORICAL REFLECTIONS
</h3>

<p>
Prior to the present war the chief bugbears
encountered by Lord Roberts, and indeed by all
others whose aim it was to provide this country with
an army numerically fit to support its policy, were
the objections, real or imaginary, of the British race
to compulsory service, and more particularly to
compulsory service in foreign lands.  These prejudices
were true types of the bugbear; for they were born
out of opinion and not out of the facts.
</p>

<p>
The smaller fry of politicians, whose fears&mdash;like
those of the monkeys&mdash;are more easily excited by
the front-row of things which are visible, than by
the real dangers which lurk behind in the shadow,
are always much more terrified of opinion than of
the facts.  This is precisely why most politicians
remain all their lives more unfit than any other class
of man for governing a country.  Give one of these
his choice&mdash;ask him whether he will prefer to support
a cause where the facts are with him, but opinion is
likely for many years to be running hard against him,
or another cause where these conditions are reversed&mdash;of
course he will never hesitate a moment about
choosing the latter.  And very probably his manner
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P402"></a>402}</span>
of answering will indicate, that he thinks you insult
his intelligence by asking such a question.
</p>

<p>
It is only the very rare type of big, patient politician,
who realises that the facts cannot be changed
by opinion, and that in the end opinion must be
changed by the facts, if the two happen to be opposed.
Such a one chooses accordingly, to follow the facts in
spite of unpopularity.
</p>

<p>
The little fellows, on the contrary, with their
large ears glued anxiously to the ground, keep ever
muttering to themselves, and chaunting in a sort of
rhythmical chorus, the most despicable incantation
in the whole political vocabulary:&mdash;"We who aspire
to be leaders of the People must see to it that we are
never in advance of the People....  The People
will never stand this: the People will never stand
that....  Away with it therefore; and if possible
attach it like a mill-stone round the necks of our
enemies."
</p>

<p>
Of course they are quite wrong.  The People will
stand anything which is necessary for the national
welfare, if the matter is explained to them by a big
enough man in accents of sincerity.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A defensive force which will on no account cross
the frontier is no defensive force at all.  It is only
a laughing-stock.
</p>

<p>
A frontier is sometimes an arbitrary line drawn
across meadow and plough; sometimes a river;
sometimes a mountain range; sometimes, as with
ourselves, it is a narrow strip of sea&mdash;a 'great ditch,'
as Cromwell called it contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
The awful significance, however, of the word
'frontier' seems to deepen and darken as we pass
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P403"></a>403}</span>
from the first example to the fourth.  And there is
apparently something more in this feeling than the
terrors of the channel crossing or of a foreign language.
Territorials may be taken to Ireland, which is a
longer sea-journey than from Dover to Calais; but
to be 'butchered abroad'&mdash;horrible!
</p>

<p>
It is horrible enough to be butchered anywhere,
but why more horrible in the valley of the Rhine
than in that of the Thames?  If national safety
demands butchery, as it has often done in the past,
surely the butchery of 50,000 brave men on the
borders of Luxemburg is a less evil than the butchery
of twice that number in the vicinity of Norwich?
And if we are to consider national comfort as well as
safety, it is surely wise to follow the German example
and fight in any man's country rather than in
our own.  The only question of real importance
is this:&mdash;At what place will the sacrifice of life
be most effective for the defence of the country?
If we can answer that we shall know also where
it will be lightest.[<a id="chap0408fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0408fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE HONOUR OF THE ARMY
</span>
</p>

<p>
The school of political thought which remained
predominant throughout the great industrial epoch
(1832-1886) bitterly resented the assumption, made by
certain classes, that the profession of arms was more
honourable in its nature, than commerce and other
peaceful pursuits.  The destruction of this supposed
fallacy produced a great literature, and even a
considerable amount of poetry.  It was a frequent theme
at the opening of literary institutes and technical
colleges, and also at festivals of chambers of commerce
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P404"></a>404}</span>
and municipalities.  Professors of Political Economy
expounded the true doctrine with great vehemence,
and sermons were preached without number upon
the well-worn text about the victories of peace.
</p>

<p>
This reaction was salutary up to a point.  It
swept away a vast quantity of superannuated rubbish.
International relations were at this time just as much
cumbered with old meaningless phrases of a certain
sort, in which vainglory was the chief ingredient, as
they have recently been cumbered with others of a
different sort in which indolence was the chief ingredient.
Inefficiency, indifference, idleness, trifling, and
extravagance were a standing charge against soldiers as
a class; and though they were never true charges
against the class, they were true, for two generations
following after Waterloo, against a large number of
individuals.  But this reaction, like most other
reactions, swept away too much.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE PROFESSION OF ARMS
</span>
</p>

<p>
A mercenary soldiery which looks to enrich itself
by pay and plunder is an ignoble institution.  It
has no right to give itself airs of honour, and must be
judged like company promotion, trusts, or any of
the many other predatory professions of modern
times.  It is also a national danger, inasmuch as its
personal interest is to foment wars.  The British
Army has never been open to this charge in any
period of its history.
</p>

<p>
A profession in which it is only possible, by the most
severe self-denial and economy, for an officer&mdash;even
after he has arrived at success&mdash;to live on his pay, to
marry, and to bring up a family, can hardly be ranked
as a money-making career.  Pecuniary motives,
indeed, were never the charge against 'the military'
except among the stump-orator class.  But
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P405"></a>405}</span>
professional indifference and inefficiency were, at that
particular time, not only seriously alleged, but were
also not infrequently true.  It was a good thing that
slackness should be swept away.  That it has been
swept away pretty thoroughly, every one who has
known anything about the Army for a generation
past, is well aware.
</p>

<p>
But the much-resented claim to a superiority in
the matter of honour is well founded, and no amount
of philosophising or political-economising will ever
shake it.  Clearly it is more honourable for a man
to risk his life, and what is infinitely more
important&mdash;his reputation and his whole future career&mdash;in
defence of his country, than it is merely to build up
a competency or a fortune.  The soldier's profession
is beset by other and greater dangers than the physical.
Money-making pursuits are not only safer for the skin,
but in them a blunder, or even a series of blunders,
does not banish the hope of ultimate success.  The
man of business has chances of retrieving his position.
Many bankrupts have died in affluence.  In politics,
a man with a plausible tongue and a certain quality
of courage, will usually succeed in eluding the
consequences of his mistakes, by laying the blame on
other people's shoulders.  But the soldier is rarely
given a second chance; and he may easily come down
at the first chance, through sheer ill-luck, and not
through any fault of his own.  Such a profession
confers honour upon its members.
</p>

<p>
Law, trade, and finance are not in themselves, as
was at one time thought, dishonourable pursuits;
but neither are they in themselves honourable.  They
are neither the one nor the other.  It casts no slur
upon a man to be a lawyer, a tradesman, or a banker;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P406"></a>406}</span>
but neither does it confer upon him any honour.
But military service does confer an honour.  The
devotion, hardship, and danger of the soldier's life are
not rewarded upon a commercial basis, or reckoned
in that currency.
</p>

<p>
Some people are inclined to mock at the respect&mdash;exaggerated
as they think&mdash;which is paid by conscript
countries to their armies.  For all its excesses and
absurdities, this respect is founded upon a true
principle&mdash;a truer principle of conduct than our own.
In countries where most of the able-bodied men
have given some years of their lives gratuitously to
the service of their country, the fact is brought home
to them, that such service is of a different character
from the benefits which they subsequently confer
upon the State by their industry and thrift, or by
growing rich.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A THEORY OF BRITISH FREEDOM
</span>
</p>

<p>
From the national point of view, it is ennobling
that at some period of their lives the great majority
of citizens should have served the commonwealth
disinterestedly.  This after all is the only principle
which will support a commonwealth.  For a commonwealth
will not stand against the shocks, which
history teaches us to beware of, merely by dropping
papers, marked with a cross, into a ballot-box once
every five years, or even oftener.  It will not stand
merely by taking an intelligent interest in events,
by attending meetings and reading the newspapers,
and by indulging in outbursts of indignation or
enthusiasm.  It will only stand by virtue of personal
service, and by the readiness of the whole people,
generation by generation, to give their lives
and&mdash;what is much harder to face&mdash;the time and irksome
preparation which are necessary for making the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P407"></a>407}</span>
sacrifice of their lives&mdash;should it be called
for&mdash;effective for its purpose.
</p>

<p>
If the mass of the people, even when they have
realised the need, will not accept the obligation of
national service they must be prepared to see their
institutions perish, to lose control of their own
destinies, and to welcome another master than
Democracy, who it may well be, will not put them
to the trouble of dropping papers, marked with a
cross, into ballot-boxes once in five years, or indeed
at all.  For a State may continue to exist even if
deprived of ballot-boxes; but it is doomed if its
citizens will not in time prepare themselves to defend
it with their lives.
</p>

<p>
The memories of the press-gang and the militia
ballot are dim.  Both belong to a past which it is
the custom to refer to with reprobation.  Both were
inconsistent with equal comradeship between classes;
with justice, dignity, honour, and the unity of the
nation; and on these grounds they are rightly
condemned.
</p>

<p>
But the press-gang and the militia ballot have
been condemned, and are still condemned, upon other
grounds which do not seem so firm.  Both have
been condemned as contravening that great and
laudable principle of British freedom which lays it
down that those who like fighting, or prefer it to
other evils&mdash;like starvation and imprisonment&mdash;or
who can be bribed, or in some other way persuaded
to fight, should enjoy the monopoly of being
'butchered,' both abroad and at home.  And it has
been further maintained by those who held these
views, that people who do not like fighting, but choose
rather to stay at home talking, criticising, enjoying
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P408"></a>408}</span>
fine thrills of patriotism, making money, and sleeping
under cover, have some kind of divine right to go on
enjoying that form of existence undisturbed.  Since
the Wars of the Roses the latter class has usually
been in a great majority in England.  Even during
the Cromwellian Civil War the numbers of men,
capable of bearing arms, who actually bore them,
was only a smallish fraction of the entire population.
</p>

<p>
The moral ideals of any community, like other
things, are apt to be settled by numbers.  With the
extension of popular government, and the increase
of the electorate, this tendency will assert itself more
and more.  But providing the people are dealt with
plainly and frankly, without flattery or deceit&mdash;like
men and not as if they were greedy children&mdash;the
moral sense of a democracy will probably be sounder
and stronger than that of any other form of State.
</p>

<p>
Even in England, however, there have been
lapses, during which the people have not been so
treated, and the popular spirit has sunk, owing to
mean leadership, into degradation.  During the whole
of the industrial epoch the idea steadily gained in
strength, that those whose battles were fought for
them by others, approached more nearly to the type
of the perfect citizen than those others who actually
fought the battles; that the protected were worthier
than the protectors.
</p>

<p>
According to this view the true meaning of
'freedom' was exemption from personal service.
The whole duty of the virtuous citizen with regard
to the defence of his country began and ended with
paying a policeman.  With the disappearance of
imminent and visible danger, the reprobate qualities
of the soldier became speedily a pain and a scandal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P409"></a>409}</span>
to godly men.  In time of peace he was apt to be
sneered at and decried as an idler and a spendthrift,
who would not stand well in a moral comparison with
those steady fellows, who had remained at home,
working hard at their vocations and investing their
savings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NINETEENTH CENTURY NOTIONS
</span>
</p>

<p>
The soldier, moreover, according to Political
Economy, was occupied in a non-productive trade,
and therefore it was contrary to the principles of that
science to waste more money upon him than could
be avoided.  Also it was prudent not to show too
much gratitude to those who had done the fighting,
lest they should become presumptuous and formidable.
</p>

<p>
This conception of the relations between the army
and the civilian population has been specially marked
at several periods in our history&mdash;after the
Cromwellian wars; after the Marlborough wars; after
1757; but during the half century which followed
Waterloo it seemed to have established itself
permanently as an article of our political creed.
</p>

<p>
After 1815 there was an utter weariness of fighting,
following upon nearly a quarter of a century of war.
The heroism of Wellington's armies was still tainted
in the popular memory by the fact that the prisons
had been opened to find him recruits.  The industrial
expansion and prodigious growth of material wealth
absorbed men's minds.  Middle-class ideals, middle-class
prosperity, middle-class irritation against a
military caste which, in spite of its comparative
poverty, continued with some success to assert its
social superiority, combined against the army in
popular discussions.  The honest belief that wars
were an anachronism, and that the world was now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P410"></a>410}</span>
launched upon an interminable era of peace, clothed
the nakedness of class prejudice with some kind of
philosophic raiment.  Soldiers were no longer needed;
why then should they continue to claim the lion's
share of honourable recognition?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Up to August 1914 the chief difficulties in the
way of army reformers were how to overcome the
firmly-rooted ideas that preparations for war upon a
great scale were not really necessary to security, and
that, on those rare occasions when fighting might be
necessary, it should not be undertaken by the most
virtuous class of citizens, but by others whose lives
had a lower value.  If the citizen paid it was enough;
and he claimed the right to grumble even at paying.
This was the old Liberal faith of the eighteen-fifties,
and it remained the faith of the straitest Radical sect,
until German guns began to batter down the forts of
Lige.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A CHANGE OF TONE
</span>
</p>

<p>
But any one who remembers the state of public
opinion between 1870 and 1890, or who has read the
political memoirs of that time, will realise that a change
has been, very slowly and gradually, stealing over public
opinion ever since the end of that epoch.  In those
earlier times the only danger which disturbed our
national equanimity, and that only very slightly,
was the approach of Russia towards the north-western
frontier of India.  The volunteer movement came
to be regarded more and more by ordinary people
in the light of a healthy and manly recreation, rather
than as a duty.  A lad would make his choice, very
much as if volunteering were on a par with rowing,
sailing, hunting, or polo.  It is probably no exaggeration
to say that nine volunteers out of every ten, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P411"></a>411}</span>
enrolled themselves between 1870 and 1890, never
believed for a single moment that there was a chance
of the country having need of their services.
Consequently, except in the case of a few extreme
enthusiasts, it never appeared that there was
anything unpatriotic in not joining the volunteers.
</p>

<p>
One has only to compare this with the attitude
which has prevailed since the Territorial Army came
into existence, to realise that there has been a stirring
of the waters, and that in certain quarters a change
had taken place in the national mood.  With regard
to the Territorials the attitude of those who joined,
of those who did not join, of the politicians, of the
press, of public opinion generally was markedly
different from the old attitude.  It was significant
that a man who did not join was often disposed to
excuse and to justify his abstention.  The
conditions of his calling, or competing duties made it
impossible for him; or the lowness of his health, or
the highness of his principles in some way interfered.
There was a tendency now to explain what previously
would never have called for any explanation.
</p>

<p>
The causes of this change are not less obvious
than its symptoms.  It is an interesting coincidence
that Lord Kitchener had a good deal to do with it.
The destruction of the bloodthirsty tyranny of the
Khalifa (1898), and the rescue of a fertile province
from waste, misery, and massacre, caused many
people to look with less disapproving eyes than
formerly upon the profession of the soldier.  The
long anxieties of the South African War, and the
levies of volunteers from all parts of the Empire, who
went out to take a share in it, forced men to think
not only more kindly of soldiers, but also to think
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P412"></a>412}</span>
of war itself no longer as an illusion but as a
reality.[<a id="chap0408fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0408fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
The events which happened during the last
decade&mdash;the creation of the German Navy&mdash;the attempt
and failure of the British Government to abate the
rivalry in armaments&mdash;the naval panic and the
hastily summoned Defence Conference in 1909&mdash;the
Russo-Japanese war&mdash;the Agadir crisis&mdash;the two
Balkan wars&mdash;the military competition between
Germany and France&mdash;all these combined to sharpen
the consciousness of danger and to draw attention
to the need for being prepared against it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These events, which crowded the beginning of the
twentieth century, stirred and troubled public opinion
in a manner which not only Mr. Cobden, who died in
1865, but almost equally Mr. Gladstone, who survived
him by more than thirty years, would have utterly
refused to credit.  Both these statesmen had been
convinced that the world was moving steadily
towards a settled peace, and that before another
century had passed away&mdash;possibly even in a single
generation&mdash;their dreams of general disarmament
would be approaching fulfilment.
</p>

<p>
And to a certain extent our own generation
remains still affected by the same notions.  Amid
the thunders of more than a thousand miles of battle
we still find ourselves clinging tenaciously to the
belief, that the world has entered suddenly, and
unexpectedly, upon an abnormal period which, from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P413"></a>413}</span>
its very nature, can only be of very brief duration.
This comforting conviction does not appear to rest
upon solid grounds.  In the light of history it would
not seem so certain that we have not passed out of
an abnormal period into the normal&mdash;if lamentable&mdash;condition
when a nation, in order to maintain its
independence, must be prepared at any moment to
fight for its life.
</p>

<p>
It would be profitless to pursue these speculations.
It is enough for our own generation that we now
find ourselves in a situation of the gravest danger;
and that it depends upon the efforts which we as a
nation put forth, more than upon anything else,
whether the danger will pass away or settle down
and become chronic.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NATURE OF GERMAN ENMITY
</span>
</p>

<p>
Although we failed to perceive or acknowledge
the danger until some nine months ago, it had been
there for at least fifteen years, probably for twice
that number.
</p>

<p>
German antagonism to England has been compounded
of envy of our possessions, contempt for
our character, and hatred of our good fortune.  What
galled our rival more than anything else, was the
fact that we enjoyed our prosperity, and held our
vast Empire, upon too easy terms.  The German
people had made, and were continuing to make,
sacrifices to maintain their position in the world,
while the British people in their view were making
none.  And if we measure national sacrifices by
personal service, and not merely in money payments,
it is difficult to see what answer is to be given to this
charge.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that unless the result of this war be to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P414"></a>414}</span>
crush Germany as completely as she herself hoped
at the beginning of it, to crush France, our own
danger will remain, unless Germany's chief grievance
against us is meanwhile removed.  It is not a
paradox, but merely a statement of plain fact, to say
that Germany's chief grievance against ourselves
was, that we were not prepared to withstand her
attack.  Her hatred, which has caused, and still
causes us so much amazement, was founded upon
the surest of foundations&mdash;a want of respect.  The
Germans despised a nation which refused to recognise
that any obligation rested on its citizens, to fit
themselves, by serious training, for defence of their
inheritance.  And they will continue to despise us
when this war is over if we should still fail to recognise
this obligation.  Despising us, they will continue
also to hate us; the peace of the world will still be
endangered; and we shall not, after all our sacrifices,
have reached the security at which we aimed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
HEART-SEARCHINGS
</span>
</p>

<p>
We may end this war without winning it, and at
the same time without being defeated.  And although
it appears to be still believed by some persons that
we can win, in some sort of fashion, without accepting
the principle of national service, even those who
entertain this dangerous confidence will hardly dare
to deny that, after a war which ends without a
crowning victory, we shall have to accept conscription
at once upon the signature of peace.
</p>

<p>
For it should be remembered that we have
other things to take into account besides the mood
of Germany.  If we stave off defeat, only with the
assistance of allies&mdash;all of whom have long ago
adopted universal military service in its most rigorous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P415"></a>415}</span>
form&mdash;we shall have to reckon with their appraisement
of the value of our assistance.  If we are
to judge by Germany's indomitable enterprise
during the past two generations, she is likely to recover
from the effects of this war at least as rapidly as
ourselves.  And when she has recovered, will she
not hunger again for our possessions, as eagerly as
before, if she sees them still inadequately guarded?
And maybe, when that time comes, there may be
some difficulty in finding allies.  For a Power which
declines to recognise the obligation of equal sacrifices,
which refuses to make preparations in time of peace,
and which accordingly, when war occurs, is ever found
unready, is not the most eligible of comrades in arms.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a recent letter the Freiherr von Hexenkchen
refers, in his sour way, to some of the matters which
have been discussed in this chapter....  "The
British People," he writes, "appear to be mightily
exercised just now about their own and their
neighbours' consciences; about what they may or may
not do with decency; about whether or no football
matches are right; or race-meetings; or plays,
music-hall entertainments, concerts, the purchase
of new clothes, and the drinking of alcohol; whether
indeed any form of enjoyment or cheerfulness ought
to be tolerated in present circumstances.
</p>

<p>
"But although you vex yourselves over these
and other problems of a similar kind, you never
seem to vex yourselves about the abscess at the
root of the tooth.
</p>

<p>
"The Holy Roman Empire, which was not holy,
nor Roman, nor yet an empire, reminds me not a
little of your so-called voluntary military system,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P416"></a>416}</span>
which is not voluntary, nor military, nor yet a
system.  It is only a chaos, a paradox, and a
laughing-stock to us Germans.
</p>

<p>
"It is our army, and not yours, which really rests
on a voluntary basis.  Our whole people for a
century past have voluntarily accepted the obligation
of universal military service.  Those amongst
us who have raised objections to this system are
but an inconsiderable fraction; negligible at any
time, but in this or any other great crisis, not merely
negligible, but altogether invisible and inaudible.
</p>

<p>
"Our people desire their army to be as it is,
otherwise it would not be as it is.  No Kaiser, or
Bureaucracy, or General Staff could impose such
a system against the public will and conscience.
Your people, on the other hand, have refused <i>as
a people</i> to accept the military obligation.  By
various devices they endeavour to fix the burden
on the shoulders of individuals.  Is this the true
meaning of the word 'voluntary'&mdash;<i>to refuse?</i> ... Sir,
I desire to be civil; but was there ever a more
conspicuous instance of cant in the whole history
of the world, than your self-righteous boastings about
your 'voluntary' military system?
</p>

<p>
"You may wonder why I bracket these two things
together&mdash;your soul-searchings about amusements
of all kinds, and your nonsensical panegyrics on the
voluntary' principle....  To my eyes they are
very closely connected.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE DUTY OF CHEERFULNESS
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Cheerfulness is a duty in time of war.  Every
man or woman who smiles, and keeps a good heart,
and goes about his or her day's work gaily, helps
by so much to sustain the national spirit.  Not
good, but harm, is done to the conduct of the war,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P417"></a>417}</span>
by moping and brooding over casualty lists, and
by speculations as to disasters which have occurred,
or are thought to be imminent.  But there is one
essential preliminary to national cheerfulness&mdash;before
a nation can be cheerful it must have a good
conscience; and it cannot have a good conscience
unless it has done its duty.
</p>

<p>
"Your nation has a bad conscience.  The reason
is that, <i>as a nation</i>, it has not done its duty.  This
may be the fault of the leaders who have not dared
to speak the word of command.  But the fact
remains, that you well know&mdash;or at any rate suspect
in your hearts&mdash;that you have not done your whole
duty.  And consequently you cannot be really
cheerful about anything.  As you go about your
daily work or recreations, you are all the while
looking back over your shoulders with misgiving.
<i>As a nation</i> you have not&mdash;even yet&mdash;dedicated
yourselves to this war.  When you have done so&mdash;if
ever you do&mdash;your burden of gloom and mistrust
will fall from your back, like that of <i>Christian</i> as he
passed along the highway, which is fenced on either
side with the Wall that is called <i>Salvation</i>."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the great American Civil War, the Southern
States, which aimed at breaking away from the Union,
adopted conscription within a year from the
beginning.  They were brave fighters; but they were
poor, and they were in a small minority.  The
Northern States&mdash;confident in their numbers and
wealth&mdash;relied at first upon the voluntary system.
It gave them great and gallant armies; but these
was not enough; and as months went by President
Lincoln realised that they were not enough.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P418"></a>418}</span>
</p>

<p>
Disregarding the entreaties of his friends, to
beware of asking of the people 'what the people
would never stand,' disregarding the clamours of
his enemies about personal freedom, he insisted upon
conscription, believing that by these means alone
the Union could be saved.  And what was the result?
A section of the press foamed with indignation.
Mobs yelled, demonstrated, and in their illogical
fury, lynched negroes, seeing in these unfortunates
the cause of all their troubles.  But the mobs were
not the American people.  They were only a noisy
and contemptible minority of the American people,
whose importance as well as courage had been vastly
over-rated.  The quiet people were in deadly earnest,
and they supported their President.[<a id="chap0408fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0408fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
LINCOLN AND CONSCRIPTION
</span>
</p>

<p>
But the task which Lincoln set himself was one
of the hardest that a democratic statesman ever
undertook.  The demand which he determined to
make, and did make, may well have tried his heart
as he sat alone in the night watches.  For compulsion
was a violation of the habits and prejudices of the
old American stock, while it was even more distasteful
to new immigrants.  It was contrary to the traditions
and theories of the Republic, and, as many thought,
to its fundamental principles.  It was open to scornful
attack on grounds of sentiment.  Against a foe who
were so weak, both in numbers and wealth, how
humiliating to be driven to such desperate measures!
But most of all&mdash;outweighing all other
considerations&mdash;this war of North and South was not only
war, but civil war.  Families and lifelong friendships
were divided.  What compulsion meant, therefore,
in this case was, that brothers were to be forced to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P419"></a>419}</span>
kill brothers, husbands were to be sent out to slay
the kinsmen of their wives, or&mdash;as they marched with
Sherman through Georgia&mdash;to set a light with their
own hands to the old homesteads where they had
been born.  Between the warring States there were
no differences of blood, tradition, or religion; or of
ideas of right and wrong; no hatred against a foreign
race; only an acute opposition of political ideals.
Compulsion, therefore, was a great thing to ask of
the American people.  But the American people
are a great people, and they understood.  And
Lincoln was a great man,&mdash;one of the greatest, noblest,
and most human in the whole of history,&mdash;and he
did not hesitate to ask, to insist, and to use force.
What the end was does not need to be stated here;
except merely this, that a lingering and bloody war
was thereby greatly shortened, and that the Union
was saved.
</p>

<p>
The British Government and people are faced
to-day with some, but not all&mdash;and not the greatest&mdash;of
Lincoln's difficulties.  Our traditions and theories
are the same, to a large extent, as those which prevailed
in America in 1863.  But unlike the North we have
had recent experience of war, and also of the sacrifices
which war calls for from the civilian population.
By so much the shock of compulsion would find us
better prepared.
</p>

<p>
But the other and much greater difficulties which
beset Lincoln do not exist in the case of the British
Government.  We are not fighting against a foe
inferior in numbers, but against one who up till now
has been greatly superior in numbers&mdash;who has also
been greatly superior in equipment, and preparation,
and in deeply-laid plans.  We are fighting against
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P420"></a>420}</span>
a foe who has invaded and encroached; not against
one who is standing on the defensive, demanding
merely to be let go free.  The family affections and
friendships which would be outraged by conscription
in this war against Germany are inconsiderable; mere
dust in the balance.  The present war is waged against
a foreign nation; it is not civil war.  It is waged
against an enemy who plainly seeks, not his own
freedom, but our destruction, and that of our Allies.
It is waged against an enemy who by the treacherous
thoroughness of his peace-time preparations, appears
to our eyes to have violated good faith as between
nations, as in the conduct of the campaign he has
disregarded the obligations of our common humanity,
We may be wrong; we may take exaggerated views
owing to the bitterness of the struggle; but such is
our mind upon the matter.
</p>

<p>
Lincoln's task would have been light had such
been the mind of the Northern States half a century
ago, and had he been faced with nothing more
formidable than the conditions which prevail in
England to-day.  It does not need the courage of a
Lincoln to demand from our people a sacrifice, upon
which the safety of the British Empire depends,
even more certainly, than in 1863 did that of the
American Union.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
THE CRUCIBLE OF WAR
</h3>

<p>
If in the foregoing pages the Liberal party has
come in for the larger share of criticism, the reason
is, that during the ten critical years, while dangers
were drawing to a head, a Liberal Government
chanced to be in power.  That things would have
been managed better and more courageously had
the Unionists been in power may be doubted; and
certainly it is no part of my present task to champion
any such theory.
</p>

<p>
The special type of politician whose influence
has wrought so much evil of late is no peculiar product
of the Liberal party.  He is the product of the party
system in its corrupt decadence.  You find him in
the ranks of the Opposition as well as in those of
the Ministerialists, just as you find good and true
men in both.  In this last lies our hope.  In our
present trouble good and true men have a chance
of taking things into their own hands, which has been
denied to them for many generations.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This book has been written to establish the <i>Need</i>
for National Service, in order that the British Empire
may maintain itself securely in the present
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P422"></a>422}</span>
circumstances of the world.  If this contention be true it
is obvious that a corresponding <i>Duty</i> lies upon
the whole nation to accept the burden of military
service.
</p>

<p>
Neither need nor duty has ever been made clear
to the British people by their leaders.  Owing to the
abuses of the party system, increasing steadily over
a considerable period of years, a certain type of
politician has been evolved, and has risen into great
prominence&mdash;a type which does not trust the people,
but only fears them.  In order to maintain themselves
and their parties in power, politicians of this
type have darkened the eyes and drugged the spirit
of the nation.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is no part of the plan of this volume to offer
criticisms upon the naval and military aspects of
the present war, or upon the wisdom or unwisdom
of the operations which have been undertaken by
land and sea.  All that need be said in this connection
may be put into a very few words.
</p>

<p>
As we read and re-read British history we cannot
but be impressed with the fact that our leading
statesmen, misled by the very brilliancy of their
intellectual endowments, have always been prone to
two errors of policy, which the simpler mind of the
soldier instinctively avoids.  They have ever been
too ready to conclude prematurely that a certain line
of obstacles is so formidable that it cannot be forced;
and they have also ever been too ready to accept
the notion, that there must surely be some ingenious
far way round, by which they may succeed in
circumventing the infinite.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
MAIN PRINCIPLE OF STRATEGY
</span>
</p>

<p>
The defect of brilliant brains is not necessarily a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P423"></a>423}</span>
want of courage&mdash;daring there has usually been in
plenty&mdash;but they are apt to lack fortitude.  They
are apt to abandon the assault upon positions which
are not really invulnerable, and to go off, chasing
after attractive butterflies, until they fall into
quagmires.  Dispersion of effort has always been the
besetting sin of British statesmen and the curse of
British policy.  There is no clearer example of this
than the case of William Pitt the Younger, who
went on picking up sugar islands all over the world,
when he ought to have been giving his whole
strength to beating Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
Very few obstacles are really insurmountable,
and it is usually the shortest and the safest course
to stick to what has been already begun.  Especially
is this the case when your resources in trained soldiers
and munitions of war are painfully restricted.  At
the one point, where you have decided to attack,
the motto is <i>push hard</i>; and at all others, where
you may be compelled to defend yourselves, the
motto is <i>hold fast</i>.
</p>

<p>
The peril of British war councils in the past has
always been (and maybe still is) the tendency of
ingenious argument to get the better of sound
judgment.  In the very opposite of this lies safety.
We find the true type of high policy, as well as
of successful campaigning, in the cool and patient
inflexibility of Wellington, holding fast by one
main idea, forcing his way over one obstacle after
another which had been pronounced invincible&mdash;through
walled cities; into the deep valleys of the
Pyrenees; across the Bidassoa&mdash;till from the crests
of the Great Rhune and the Little his soldiers looked
down at last upon the plains of France.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P424"></a>424}</span>
</p>

<p>
Our most urgent problem with regard to the
present war, is how we may win it most thoroughly;
but, in addition to this, there are two questions
which have recently engaged a good deal of public
attention.  There is a <i>Political</i> question&mdash;what sort
of European settlement is to take place after the
war?  And there is also a <i>Criminal</i> question&mdash;what
sort of punishment shall be meted out, if crimes,
contrary to the practice of war among civilised
and humane states, have been committed by our
antagonists?
</p>

<p>
I have not attempted to deal with either of these.
They do not seem to be of extreme urgency; for
unless, and until, we win the war it is somewhat idle
to discuss the ultimate fate of Europe or the penalty
of evil deeds.  You cannot restore stolen property
until you have recovered it, and you cannot punish
a malefactor, nor is it very convenient even to try
him, while he is still at large.  If that be true, which
was said of old by a great king&mdash;<i>I do not make peace
with barbarians but dictate the terms of their
surrender</i>&mdash;we are still a long way from that.
</p>

<p>
I have not occupied myself therefore with what
are termed 'German atrocities.'  So far as this
matter is concerned, I am satisfied to let it rest for
the present upon the German statement of intentions
before war began,[<a id="chap0409fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn1">1</a>] and upon the proclamations which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P425"></a>425}</span>
have been issued subsequently, with the object of
justifying their mode of operations by sea and land.
The case against Germany on her own admission, is
quite strong enough without opening a further
inquisition under this heading.[<a id="chap0409fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn2">2</a>]

</p>

<p>
It is essential, however, to realise the falsities
and perversities upon which the great fabric of
German policy is founded; for otherwise we shall
never understand either the nature of the enemy
with whom we are at present engaged, or the full
extent of the danger by which, not only we, but
civilisation itself is now threatened.  It is essential
that the whole British race should understand the
nature of the evils <i>against</i> which they are fighting&mdash;the
ambitions of Germany&mdash;the ruthless despotism
of the Prussian system&mdash;the new theories of right
and wrong which have been evolved by thinkers
who have been paid, promoted, and inspired by the
State, in order to sanctify the imperial policy of
spoliation.
</p>

<p>
It is also essential for us to realise the nature of
those things <i>for</i> which we are fighting&mdash;what we
shall save and secure for our posterity in case of
victory; what we stand to lose in event of defeat.
The preservation or ruin of our inheritance, spiritual
and material&mdash;the maintenance or overthrow of our
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P426"></a>426}</span>
institutions, traditions, and ideas&mdash;the triumph, of
these, or the supplanting of them by a wholly
different order, which to our eyes wears the appearance
of a vast machine under the control of savages&mdash;are
the main issues of the present war.  And when
now at last, we face them squarely, we begin to
wonder, why of late years, we have been wont to
treat problems of national defence and imperial
security with so much levity and indifference.
</p>

<p>
It is profitable to turn our eyes from the
contemplation of German shortcomings inwards upon
our own.  If we have been guilty as a people
during recent times of weakness, blindness, indolence,
or cowardice, we should face these facts squarely,
otherwise there is but a poor chance of arriving at
better conditions.  If we have refused to listen to
unpleasant truths, and to exchange a drowsy and
dangerous comfort against sacrifices which were
necessary for security, it is foolish to lay the whole
blame upon this or that public man, this or that
government.  For, after all, both public men and
governments were our own creation; we chose them
because we liked them; because it gave us pleasure
and consolation to listen to their sayings; because
their doings and their non-doings, their un-doings
and their mis-doings were regarded with approval
or indifference by the great bulk of our people.
</p>

<p>
It would be wise also to take to heart the lesson,
plainly written across the record of the last nine
months, that the present confusion of our political
system is responsible, as much as anything&mdash;perhaps
more than anything&mdash;for the depreciated currency
of public character.  The need is obvious for a
Parliament and a Government chosen by the Empire,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P427"></a>427}</span>
responsible to the Empire, and charged with the
security of the Empire, and with no other task.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
CAUSES OF WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH
</span>
</p>

<p>
Why we are fighting at all is one of our problems;
why we are finding it so hard to win is another.  In
what does the main strength of our enemies consist?
And in what does our own chief weakness consist?
</p>

<p>
To say that our weakness is to be sought in our
own vices, and the strength of our enemies in their
virtues, is of course a commonplace.  But one has
only to open the average newspaper to realise the
need for restating the obvious.  For there the
contrary doctrine is set forth daily and weekly with
a lachrymose insistency&mdash;that our hands are weakened
because we are so good; that the Germans fight at
an enormous advantage because they are so wicked
and unscrupulous.
</p>

<p>
But the things which we are finding hardest to
overcome in our foes are not the immoral gibberings of
professors, or the blundering cynicism of the German
Foreign Office, or the methodical savagery of the
General Staff, whether in Belgium or on the High
Seas.  These are sources of weakness and not of
strength; and even at the present stage it is clear
that, although they have inflicted immeasurable
suffering, they have done the German cause much
more harm than good.
</p>

<p>
Our real obstacles are the loyalty, the self-sacrifice,
and the endurance of the German people.
</p>

<p>
The causes of British weakness are equally plain.
Our indolence and factiousness; our foolish
confidence in cleverness, manoeuvres, and debate for
overcoming obstacles which lie altogether outside
that region of human endeavour; our absorption as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P428"></a>428}</span>
thrilled spectators in the technical game of British
politics[<a id="chap0409fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn3">3</a>]&mdash;these vices and others of a similar
character, which, since the beginning of the war we have
been struggling&mdash;like a man awakening from a nightmare&mdash;to
shake off, are still our chief difficulties.  It
is a hard job to get rid of them, and we are not yet
anything like halfway through with it.
</p>

<p>
It must be clear to every detached observer,
that the moral strength of England in the present
struggle&mdash;like that of France&mdash;does not lie in
Government or Opposition, but in the spirit of the people;
that this spirit has drawn but little support, in the
case of either country, from the leadership and
example of the politicians; and that there is little
cause in either case to bless or praise them for the
fidelity of their previous stewardship.  In the case of
France this national spirit was assured at the
beginning; in our own case the process of awakening has
proceeded much more slowly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
ILLUSIONS OF SUCCESS
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is essential to put certain notions out of our
heads and certain other notions into them.  From
the beginning of the war, a large part of the
press&mdash;acting, we are entitled to suppose, in patriotic
obedience to the directions of the Press Bureau&mdash;has
fostered ideas which do not correspond with the
facts.  Information has been doled out and presented
in such a way as to destroy all sense of proportion
in the public mind.
</p>

<p>
It is not an uncommon belief,[<a id="chap0409fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn4">4</a>] for example, that
we with our Allies&mdash;ever since the first onset, when,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P429"></a>429}</span>
being virtuously unprepared, we were pushed back
some little distance&mdash;have been doing much better
than the Germans; that for months past our
adversaries have been in a desperate plight&mdash;lacking
ammunition, on the verge of bankruptcy and
starvation, and thoroughly discouraged.
</p>

<p>
There is also a tendency to assume&mdash;despite Lord
Kitchener's grave and repeated warnings to the
contrary&mdash;that the war is drawing rapidly to a
conclusion, and that, even if we may have to submit
to some interruption of our usual summer holidays,
at any rate we shall eat our Christmas dinners in an
atmosphere of peace and goodwill.
</p>

<p>
The magnitude of the German victories, both in the
East and West, during the earlier stages of the war,
is not realised even now by the great majority of
our fellow-countrymen; while the ruinous consequences
of these victories to our Allies&mdash;the occupation
of Belgium, of a large part of northern France,
and of Western Poland&mdash;is dwelt on far too lightly.
Nor is it understood by one man in a hundred, that
up to the end of last year, British troops were never
holding more than thirty miles, out of that line of
nearly five hundred which winds, like a great snake,
from Nieuport to the Swiss frontier.  On the
contrary, it is quite commonly believed that we have
been doing our fair share of the fighting&mdash;or even
more&mdash;by land as well as sea.
</p>

<p>
A misleading emphasis of type and comment,
together with a dangerous selection of items of news,
are responsible for these illusions; while the
prevalence of these illusions is largely responsible for
many of our labour difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Such dreams of inevitable and speedy victory
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P430"></a>430}</span>
are no doubt very soothing to indolent and timid
minds, but they do not make for a vigorous and
resolute spirit in the nation, upon which, more
than upon anything else, the winning of this war
depends.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In some quarters there appears still to linger a
ridiculous idea that we went into this war, out of
pure chivalry, to defend Belgium.[<a id="chap0409fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn5">5</a>]  We went into
it to defend our own existence, and for no other
reason.  We made common cause with Allies who
were menaced by the same danger as ourselves; but
these, most fortunately, had made their preparations
with greater foresight than we had done.  The actual
fighting has taken place, so far, in their territories
and not in ours; but the issue of this war is not one
whit less a matter of life-or-death for us, than it is
for them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
DEMOCRACY NOT INVINCIBLE
</span>
</p>

<p>
Quite recently I have seen our present situation
described glowingly and self-complacently as the
'triumph of the voluntary system.'  I must be
blind of both eyes, for I can perceive no 'triumph'
and no 'voluntary' system.  I have seen the
territories of our Allies seized, wasted, and held fast
by an undefeated enemy.  I have seen our small
army driven back; fighting with as much skill
and bravery as ever in its history; suffering losses
unparalleled in its history; holding its own in
the end, but against what overwhelming numbers
and by what sacrifices!  The human triumph is
apparent enough; but not that of any system,
voluntary or otherwise.  Neither in this record of
nine months' 'hard and hot fighting' on land, nor in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P431"></a>431}</span>
the state of things which now exists at the end of it
all, is there a triumph for anything, or any one, save
for a few thousands of brave men, who were left to
hold fast as best they could against intolerable odds.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Certain contemporary writers appear to claim
more for that form of representative government,
which we are in the habit of calling 'democracy,'
than it is either safe to count on, or true to assert.  In
their eyes democracy seems to possess a superiority
in all the higher virtuous qualities&mdash;'freedom,' in
particular&mdash;and also an inherent strength
which&mdash;whatever may be the result of the present
war&mdash;makes the final predominance of British institutions
only a matter of time.[<a id="chap0409fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
I do not hold with either of these doctrines.
Universal superiority in virtue and strength is too
wide a claim to put forward for any system of government.
And 'freedom' is a very hard thing to define.
</p>

<p>
It is not merely that the form of constitution,
which we call 'democracy,' is obviously not the best
fitted for governing an uncivilised or half-civilised
people.  There are considerations which go much
deeper than that&mdash;considerations of race, religion,
temperament, and tradition.  As it has been in the
past, so conceivably it may be again in the future,
that a people, which is in the highest degree civilised
and humane, will seek to realise its ideals of freedom
in some other sphere than the control of policy and
legislation according to the electoral verdicts of its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P432"></a>432}</span>
citizens.  It is even possible that its national
aspirations may regard some other end as a higher good
even than freedom.  We cannot speak with certainty
as to the whole human race, but only with regard to
ourselves and certain others, who have been bred
in the same traditions.
</p>

<p>
If a personal and autocratic government&mdash;the
German for example&mdash;is able to arouse and maintain
among its people a more ardent loyalty, a firmer
confidence, a more constant spirit of self-sacrifice
(in time of peace as well as war), I can see no good
reason for the hope, that democracy, merely because,
in our eyes, it approaches more nearly to the ideal
of the Christian Commonwealth, will be able to
maintain itself against the other.  A highly centralised
system of government has great natural advantages
both for attack and defence; and if in addition it be
supported by a more enduring fortitude, and a more
self-denying devotion, on the part of the people, it
seems almost incredible that, in the end, it will not
prevail over other forms of government which have
failed to enlist the same support.
</p>

<p>
The strength of all forms of government alike,
whether against foreign attack or internal disintegration,
must depend in the long last upon the spirit
of the people; upon their determination to maintain
their own institutions; upon their willingness to
undertake beforehand, as well as during the excitement
of war, those labours and sacrifices which are
necessary for security.  The spirit is everything.
And in the end that spirit which is strongest is likely
to become predominant, and to impose its own forms,
systems, and ideas upon civilised and uncivilised
nations alike.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P433"></a>433}</span>
</p>

<p>
A considerable part of the world&mdash;though it may
have adopted patterns of government which are either
avowedly democratic or else are monarchies of the
constitutional sort (in essence the same)&mdash;is by no
means wedded to popular institutions; has no deep-rooted
traditions to give them support; could easily,
therefore, and without much loss of self-respect,
abandon them and submit to follow new fashions.
But with the United Kingdom, the self-governing
Dominions, and the United States it is altogether
different.
</p>

<p>
To exchange voluntarily, merely because circumstances
rendered it expedient to do so, a system
which is the only one consistent with our notions of
freedom would be an apostasy.  It would mean our
immediate spiritual ruin, and for that reason also
our ultimate material ruin.  On the other hand, to
continue to exist on sufferance, without a voice in
the destinies of the world, would be an even deeper
degradation.  To be conquered outright, and absorbed,
would be an infinitely preferable fate to either of these.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NEED OF LEADERSHIP
</span>
</p>

<p>
The nations of the world have one need in
common&mdash;Leadership.  The spirit of the people can do much,
but it cannot do everything.  In the end that form
of government is likely to prevail which produces the
best and most constant supply of leaders.  On its
own theories, democracy of the modern type ought
to out-distance all competitors; under this system
capacity, probity, and vigour should rise most easily
to the top.
</p>

<p>
In practice, however, democracy has come under
the thumb of the Party System, and the Party System
has reached a very high point of efficiency.  It has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P434"></a>434}</span>
bettered the example of the hugest mammoth store
in existence.  It has elaborated machinery for
crushing out independent opinion and for cramping the
characters of public men.  In commending its wares
it has become as regardless of truth as a vendor of
quack medicines.  It pursues corruption as an end,
and it freely uses corruption&mdash;both direct and
indirect&mdash;as the means by which it may attain its end.  If
the Party System continues to develop along its
present lines, it may ultimately prove as fatal to the
principle of democracy as the ivy which covers and
strangles the elm-trees in our hedgerows.
</p>

<p>
Leadership is our greatest present need, and it
is there that the Party System has played us false.
To manipulate its vast and intricate machinery there
arose a great demand for expert mechanicians, and
these have been evolved in a rich profusion.  But
in a crisis like the present, mechanicians will not
serve our purpose.  The real need is a Man, who by
the example of his own courage, vigour, certainty,
and steadfastness will draw out the highest qualities
of the people; whose resolute sense of duty will brush
opportunism aside; whose sympathy and truthfulness
will stir the heart and hold fast the conscience of the
nation.  Leadership of this sort we have lacked.
</p>

<p>
The Newcastle speech with its soft words and
soothing optimism was not leadership.  It does not
give confidence to a horse to know that he has a
rider on his back who is afraid of him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
NEED FOR FRANKNESS
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is idle at this stage to forecast the issue of the
present war.  Nevertheless we seem at last to have
begun to understand that there is but a poor chance
of winning it under rulers who are content to wait
and see if by some miracle the war will win itself;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P435"></a>435}</span>
or if by another miracle our resources of men and
material will organise themselves.  Since the battle
of the Marne many sanguine expectations of a speedy
and victorious peace have fallen to the ground.
The constant burden of letters from soldiers at the
front is that the war&mdash;so far as England is concerned&mdash;is
only just beginning.  And yet, in spite of all these
disappointments and warnings, the predominant
opinion in official circles is still, apparently, as
determined as ever to wait and see <i>what the people
will stand</i>, although it is transparently clear what they
ought to stand, and must stand, if they are to remain
a people.
</p>

<p>
We cannot forecast with certainty the issue of the
present war, but hope nevertheless refuses to be bound.
There is a false hope and a true one.  There may be
consolation for certain minds, but there is no safety
for the nation, in the simple faith that democracy
is in its nature invincible.  Democracy is by no
means invincible.  On the contrary, it fights at a
disadvantage, both by reason of its inferiority in
central control, and because it shrinks from
ruthlessness.  Nevertheless we may believe as firmly as
those who hold this other opinion that in the end it
will conquer.  Before this can happen it must find
a leader who is worthy of its trust.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Since August 1914 we have learned many things
from experience which we previously refused to
credit upon any human authority.  We are not
altogether done with the past; for it contains lessons
and warnings&mdash;about men as well as things&mdash;which it
would be wasteful to forget.  But our main concern
is with the present.  And we are also treading very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P436"></a>436}</span>
close on the heels of the future, when&mdash;as we
trust&mdash;the resistance of our enemies will be beginning to
flag; when the war will be drawing to an end;
afterwards through anxious years (how many we
cannot guess) when the war has ended, and when the
object of our policy will be to keep the peace which
has been so dearly bought.
</p>

<p>
Lord Roberts was right in his forecast of the
danger; nor was he less right in his perception of
England's military weakness and general
unpreparedness for war.  But was he also right as to the
principle of the remedy which he proposed?  And
even if he were right as things stood when he uttered
his warnings, is his former counsel still right in our
present circumstances, and as we look forward into
the future?  Is it now necessary for us to accept
in practice what has always been admitted in the
vague region of theory&mdash;that an obligation lies upon
every citizen, during the vigour of his age, to place
his services, and if need be his life, at the disposal
of that state under whose shelter he and all those
who are most dear to him have lived?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
THE PEOPLE WILL NOT FLINCH
</span>
</p>

<p>
There is always danger in treating a free people
like children; in humouring them, and coaxing them,
and wheedling them with half-truths; in asking
for something less than is really needed, from fear
that to ask for the whole would alarm them too
much; with the foolish hope that when the first
demand has been granted it will then be easy enough
to make them understand how much more is still
necessary to complete the fabric of security; that
having deceived them once, it will be all the easier
to deceive them again.
</p>

<p>
As we look back over our country's history we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P437"></a>437}</span>
find that it was those men who told the people the
whole truth&mdash;or what, at least, they themselves
honestly believed to be the whole truth&mdash;who most
often succeeded in carrying their proposals through.
In these matters, which touch the very life and soul
of the nation, all artifice is out of place.  The power
of persuasion lies in the truthfulness of the advocate,
no less than in the truth of his plea.  If the would-be
reformer is only half sincere, if from timidity or
regard for popular opinion he chooses to tell but half
his tale&mdash;selecting this, suppressing that, postponing
the other to a more propitious season&mdash;he loses by
his misplaced caution far more than half his strength.
When there is a case to be laid before the British
People it is folly to do it piecemeal, by astute stages
of pleading, and with subtle reservations.  If the
whole case can be put unflinchingly it is not the
People who will flinch.  The issue may be left with
safety to a tribunal which has never yet failed in
its duty, when rulers have had the courage to say
where its duty lay.
</p>

[<a href="#chap0409fn1text">1</a>] "A war conducted with energy cannot
be directed merely against the
combatants of the enemy State and the
positions they occupy, but it will
and must in like manner seek to destroy

men and their goods, can only be taken
into consideration in so far as the

</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0409fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0409fn2text">2</a>] Clearly, however, when it comes
to the discussion of terms of peace,
not only the political question,
but also the criminal question, will have to
be remembered.  Oddly enough the 'pacifist'
section, which has already
been clamorous for putting forward peace
proposals, seems very anxious
that we should forget, or at any rate ignore,
the criminal question&mdash;odd,
because 'humanity' is the stuff they have
set up their bills to trade in.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
